3,1,"On the door dash app whenever I order drinks such as the ice tea, it never tastes the same compared to when I order from the drive thru or in store. The drinks are often bland and devoid of flavor even though I ask for sugar or other flavoring. I tried more than one store too. This also applies to the ice coffees and I since stopped ordering them because they were tasting bad.

Here are the options provided in door dash for ice tea. Picking 6 sugar still made my ice tea taste sugarless. What am I doing wrong?

The hot Dunkaccinos were my favorite drink, and now all of my Dunkins seemingly have finally gotten rid of them. Yes, I did live in a place where we still had them until like, a week ago. 

I'm not used to drinking straight-up coffee with random flavor shots, nor do I speak ""coffee"". In short, I have no idea what I'm doing. Take for instance this morning where I ordered a mocha with a caramel shot and like, 2 creams bc I didn't understand what I was doing. It does not taste... great at all. 

I'm wondering if anyone has an order I can do that would taste somewhat like a Dunkaccino? As close as I can get? Sadly it seems like even some Dunkins around me don't even have the ability to make hot chocolates anymore either so I don't think I can use that to my advantage right now. 

Short of just making the Dunkaccino at home with replica recipes, which I don't always have the time to do — just looking for an order I can say at the drive-thru that's close enough to a Dunkaccino where it doesn't taste like I'm drinking straight-up coffee and it's just as satisfying.

103,1,"I'm a shift leader at a Dunkin. We have a fruit fly infestation every summer. Most of the time it's because the air conditioning breaks every year, and we have to choose between sweating to death or opening the back door for flies to come in.

This year, however, they fixed the AC on July (because the district manager had to actually spend time in the store to train a new manager so she finally saw that it was 95 Fahrenheit in here and decided she should do something because she's suffering) 

Anyways we haven't been keeping the back door open but we still have a lot of fruit flies. We all know about it. But nobody will do anything about it. I've tried to have the crew clean like crazy but they keep only putting 3 people on for days and we literally don't even get time to take breaks (even though my manager keeps taking the breaks out of our paycheck) 

So we can't clean...not even at night bc they keep complaining about labor so day crew has to vanish as soon as their shift is over and we can't clean up so night crew has to clean our mess. 

Every now and then I try to clean out the drains but most of the drains are so filled with stuff that they don't even DRAIN. This is something thats also been a problem for years. 

The thing that threw me over the edge today was finding a fruit fly crawling on sandwich station. It immediately made me want to close the store down. And then...I found one in the coffee cup I was preparing. Just drowning in the cream. 

I know that the only way anything will happen is if someone calls someone outside of the store to do something about it. Because they've been known about it and haven't done anything besides get 1 trap like 2 months ago....

Consumers now have to spend anywhere from $10-$40 more just to get a free drink and sales are probably gonna go down as a result. That thing for people who buy coffee 12 or more times in a month getting extra rewards… how many people actually get coffee out that many times for it to be worth it?

I’ve never had anything put me behind as much as the omelette bites. Especially considering that they take much long to cook than most items to make. 

 Every once and a while one will be really easy to open but that is only them luring you into a false sense of security. They would be easy to make if they were all like that.

I have recently been trying to saw the package open with a knife though that is not an easy feat as they are also incredibly delicate.

I try to pre make them when I can but they aren’t quite popular enough to do that without the risk of having to throw a bunch a way at the end of the night, which would just be sad and wasteful.

262,1,"I have an interview with Dunkin Donuts in a few days. The job is a crew member. My responsibilities will include but will not be limited to thoroughly cleaning tables, obeying safety and sanitation guidelines, handling cash register transactions and pouring coffee. 

I have done research to find out what types of questions I can expect to receive during the interview. Below is a list of possible questions and the answers I have drafted. I will gladly accept any feedback. It is doubtful that every single one of these questions would be asked, but some of them will and I don’t know which ones will and which ones won’t be asked, so I need to be prepared. Please focus not on how likely it is that I will be asked these questions, but on whether or not the answers I have drafted would make sense had these questions been asked. 

**What are your strengths**?

I am a quick learner. I am enthusiastic and hungry to learn. Furthermore, I take criticism really well. If I have done something wrong, I want to be told what I did wrong. Therefore, you will never have to worry about me making the same mistake twice. 

**What is your biggest weakness**? 

With what little work experience I have, I am a work in progress. However, being so new to this profession, I can be shaped into the perfect employee. 

**What are your career goals**?

At the moment, I am in a discovery phase. In an attempt to find myself, I want a job that will remind me about the value of hard work and enable me to challenge myself. I hope to be able to multitask, so that I may learn, grow and develop. 

**Where do you see yourself five years from now**? 

Five years from now, I plan to still be working here. Hopefully, I will have contributed to the company enough to be seen as a trusted and reliable member of my team. While still in the ame role, I would have a wide range of responsibilities. I would be the go to person for advice and expertise in my area. 

**When are you available to work**?

I am available to work anytime. 

**Tell me about yourself**.

There is so much to tell, it is hard to know where to begin. 

In undergrad, I completed an internship working on nightly and weekend programming. This job enabled me to work with students who had learning disabilities. I would help to coordinate events. I would help with the set up and clean up. During the event itself, I would interact with the students and ensure that they were having a good time and obeying all school rules. If I am hired to work at Dunkin Donuts, it would be my job to ensure that the customers have a pleasant experience. 

**Walk me through your resume**.  

I have done landscaping jobs before. I once shovelled snow out of the driveway of a customer who was unable to shovel himself due to back problems. I was self-employed and the pay was not steady. I had to seek out opportunities for work. I did not have the same sense or order that I would have at a job that takes place in a building where I punch in and punch out. That is why I would like a job like this, where I am told when to show up and what to do when I am here. 

I recently finished school. My major was psychology. I knew that the courses that I took in school were no guarantee of figuring out what I wanted to do with my life. However, by understanding human nature, I would be able to better understand the world, which would help me connect with people and figure out how to find work. 

My last semester of undergrad, I worked an unpaid internship on nightly and weekend programming for the Thames program. The Thames program at Mitchell College is a program for students with learning disabilities. I assisted with the prep work, set up and cleaned up for many events. During these events, I would interact with and act as a role model for younger students. As an intern, there was a degree of creativity involved with the job, but for the most part, I followed orders given to me by my supervisor. I foresee this job as one that is mostly about obeying an employer. I intend to set up the place to open and/or clean up the place before leaving after closing. 

**How did you hear about this job**?

I received an email notification from Indeed.com. I like challenges. This job is physically demanding, because you have to lift objects that weigh as much as 35 pounds. The job is also socially challenging, you must greet customers and ensure that people have a pleasant experience when the people in question are complete strangers and you do not know what they like. This job sounds challenging in a good way. This job sounds exactly like a challenging task I have been looking for this whole time. 

**Why do you want to work at this company**? 

I want to work at Dunkin Donuts, because the clientele is very diverse and should provide an opportunity to meet new people and learn new things. 

This restaurant's target demographic is the working class. These are the people who come here to get a coffee and a sausage egg and cheese sandwich right before work. I take great joy in my genuine desire to make life easier or more convenient for the average American. 

**Why should we hire you**? 

My biggest strength and potential contribution to the company would have to be that I am a team player. In a restaurant staff, it is expected that we, as workers, take care of our own and put the needs of the customers first. Having majored in Behaviour Science in undergrad, I have learned how to get along with people and work as a team. When I did community service for Sacred Heart School in Taftville, I would be assigned a task and expected to do it under a time constraint, as the cafeteria was supposed to be used by someone else for something else at an allotted time. Therefore, I know how to not only do a good job, but complete a job by a strict deadline. Also, I was a student-athlete in high school. From this experience, I built up stamina and learned to multi-task. 

**When did you have to work under stress? How did you handle it**?

When I completed an internship in undergrad, I had to complete 100 hours by the end of the semester. I dealt with that stress the same way I dealt with any other form of stress, by using the one year rule. If ever I am stressed about anything, I simply ask myself, will this still be on my mind in a year? If the answer is no, then logically there is no reason to be worried, as it will all blow over in 365 days or less. If, however, the answer is yes, then there is still no reason to be worried, as even if things do not go as planned, there will be plenty more opportunities to rectify what went wrong. I also ask myself this one question. What is the worst thing that can happen? Stress is what you feel when you are not sure what the outcome will be and you know that the outcome could be undesirable. When you take a driving test, you feel stressed, because you might not pass. If you ask yourself what the worst thing that can happen is, you may be surprised to discover that the worst thing that can happen is not only pretty unlikely to happen in the first place, if it were to happen, it would not be that bad. 

**Do you prefer to work alone or as part of a team**? 

I like to work as part of a team. I also enjoy working alone with close supervision. When I did my internship in college, I would interact with my supervisors, the other interns and my teacher. It was all up to me to ensure that I fulfilled my responsibilities. I was supervised in regards to the jobs that I did for the school, but it was my responsibility to ensure that my work was completed in time. 

**How would you deal with a conflict**?

If ever I dealt with a conflict, whether it be work related or inter personal, I would say to the other person the following; 

“It seems to me that you are upset or angry that something has been done wrong. Would you please tell me what I have done wrong, why it was wrong and what, if anything, can be done to improve the situation?” 

That is verbatim what I would say in response to a complaint.

**How would you remain motivated in your work**?

I consistently ask myself; Am I a better person than I was a year ago? And what do I need to do to become better over the course of the next 365 days? I think of it in terms of years, not days. Everyone has bad days. You don’t know if you will improve from one day to the next, but there is no excuse for regressing from one year to the next. 

**What is your ideal working environment**?

My ideal working environment is one where everyone makes it a priority to build others up. No one is perfect. When a fellow worker makes a mistake, the appropriate response is to either correct the mistake or teach the person who made the mistake to correct it himself or herself. This expectation should apply in all directions, employee toward employer, employer toward employee and employee toward other employee.  

**Is there anything you have done in the past that you wish you had done differently**? 

When I did community service for Sacred Heart school, I was tasked with vacuuming the carpets. I unplugged the vacuum cleaner before turning it off. I received a shock.  

**If you have a day when you are not busy, what would you do**?

I would ask my supervisor if anything else needs to be done, hoping he or she has a task for me. 

**Why is it important for all policies and standards to be obeyed**?

Policies, procedures and standards are set in place with the intent to work toward a common goal. If some people in a staff or faculty disobey policies, a common goal will never be achieved. 

**When can you start? When are you available**?

I am capable of beginning immediately. I am available to work any shift. 

**Are you able to travel**? 

Although I do not have my own vehicle, I will have transportation for scheduled shifts. 

**Do you have any experience working in fast food**? 

I do not. 

**Why are you interested in working with us**? 

I am a regular customer of Dunkin Donuts. Every product, the donuts, coffee, hot chocolate, and breakfast sandwiches are amazing. I am impressed by the quality of the products, not to mention the customer service. If I work here, I can spread joy through a cup of coffee and make customers loyal to the brand. Furthermore, the fast paced environment is my ideal workplace. 

**What do you know about the company**? 

When William Rosenberg founded Dunkin Donuts in 1950, the company first did business in Quincy Massachusetts. The slogan “America runs on Dunkin” is accurate. It is the most popular coffee seller in the country, measured by the number of coffee cups sold. Dunkin Donuts sells over 2 billions cups of coffee in a single calendar year. 

**Why us and not our competitors**? 

As a loyal customer of Dunkin Donuts, I know that Dunkin Donuts produces products of much higher quality at a lower price compared to other companies. Year after year, Dunkin Donuts has not dropped in quality at all. The clientele is very diverse and should provide an opportunity to meet new people and learn new things. This restaurant's target demographic is the working class. These are the people who come here to get a coffee and a sausage egg and cheese sandwich right before work. I take great joy in my genuine desire to make life easier or more convenient for the average American. 

**Why should we hire you**? 

My biggest strength and potential contribution to the company would have to be that I am a team player. In a restaurant staff, it is expected that we, as workers, take care of our own and put the needs of the customers first. Having majored in Behaviour Science in undergrad, I have learned how to get along with people and work as a team. When I did community service for Sacred Heart School in Taftville, I would be assigned a task and expected to do it under a time constraint, as the cafeteria was supposed to be used by someone else for something else at an allotted time. Therefore, I know how to not only do a good job, but complete a job by a strict deadline. Also, I was a student-athlete in high school. From this experience, I built up stamina and learned to multi-task. 

**How would you deal with an unsatisfied customer**? 

I would offer my condolences, ask why the experience was unpleasant and ask what, if anything, I am capable of doing to remedy the situation so that it never occurs again. If it is possible to fulfil the customer’s request while obeying the rules set in place by my employer, I will do so. 

**Can you work under pressure**? 

I can definitely work under pressure. Pressure makes me a more competent worker. When I completed an internship in undergrad, the knowledge that I had to complete 100 hours of service by the end of the semester gave me the incentive I needed to reach out to people and ask if there were any favours they needed. When my professor told me that failure to complete 100 hours would result in an F for the course and course credit being withheld, I immediately knew that I needed to reach out and seek opportunities as soon as possible. 

**What do you foresee being the biggest challenge at this job**? 

I have always wanted to work here and never given much thought to the challenges that are likely to come up. I imagine I will face the typical challenges associated with a fast paced environment. I am sure that it will be nothing unsolvable. When I face a challenge or I am out of my comfort zone, there is no need to talk about how uncomfortable I am. My discomfort is my problem, no one else’s. I will deal with the discomfort myself one time. When talking to others I will focus on the positive. 

**What would you do if a customer asked to speak to the manager**? 

I would first ask what the problem is and whether or not I can help. If I can help, I will. If, however, I lack the ability to solve the problem myself or the customer insists on seeing the manager, then I will get the manager immediately. 

**How reliable are you**? 

I pride myself in always showing up and time, doing my best and receiving all the constructive criticism that is useful to me. If I am unable to show up, I intend to give my employer and coworkers notice well in advance. 

**How do you intend to provide excellent customer service**? 

I will always provide service with a smile. In other words, have a positive perky attitude when greeting a customer. I will lead the customer to a seat for an in house order. To ensure that the customer is attended to in a timely manner, I will be sure to sit or stand in a location where I can easily identify a customer and a customer could easily identify me. 

**What would you do if you caught a fellow employee stealing from the cash register**? 

I do not tolerate unethical behaviour such as stealing. I will report the theft in such a way as standard procedure dictates. This is rarely an issue for me in the first place, as the vast majority of people who I have ever met have proper respect for other people’s property. 

**How do you achieve proper work-life balance**? 

When I am not at work, I throw myself into my hobbies. I enjoy athletic activities like hiking, leisure activities like playing video games and intellectually stimulating activities such as reading classic novels and writing movie reviews. 

**What would you do if a customer ordered in house and refused to pay**? 

I hope I never have to deal with that, but should such an unfortunate circumstance arise, I would speak to security or management, who are trained to handle such situations. 

**What have you done to better your understanding of this field in the last five years**? 

In school, I took several classes in psychology and marketing. This taught me a lot about the economy, customer service, human nature and how to behave professionally. 

**How would you prioritise tasks during a busy period**?

The customer always comes first. 

If I am in the middle of setting a table and a party enters as the phone is ringing, I would drop what I am doing, escort the customer to their table, answer the phone and then finish setting the table in that order. 

**How do you intend to blend with our existing team**? 

I have pretty good communication and people skills. I respect people’s boundaries. If the employee is more experienced than I am, I will look to him or her for guidance

**Do you have any questions for me**? (This is what the interviewer will ask).

i consistently ask myself; am i a better person than i was a year ago? and what do i need to do to become better over the course of the next 365 days? i think of it in terms of years, not days. everyone has bad days. you don't know if you will improve from one day to the next, but there is no excuse for regressing from one year to the next.
**what is your ideal working environment**?
my ideal working environment is one where everyone makes it a priority to build others up. no one is perfect. when a fellow worker makes a mistake, the appropriate response is to either correct the mistake or teach the person who made the mistake to correct it himself or herself. this expectation should apply in all directions, employee toward employer, employer toward employee and employee toward other employee.
**is there anything you have done in the past that you wish you had done differently**?
when i did community service for sacred heart school, i was tasked with vacuuming the carpets. i unplugged the vacuum cleaner before turning it off. i received a shock.
**if you have a day when you are not busy, what would you do**?
i would ask my supervisor if anything else needs to be done, hoping he or she has a task for me.
**why is it important for all policies and standards to be obeyed**?
policies, procedures and standards are set in place with the intent to work toward a common goal. if some people in a staff or faculty disobey policies, a common goal will never be achieved.
**when can you start? when are you available**?
i am capable of beginning immediately. i am available to work any shift.
**are you able to travel**?
although i do not have my own vehicle, i will have transportation for scheduled shifts.
**do you have any experience working in fast food**?
i do not.
**why are you interested in working with us**?
i am a regular customer of dunkin donuts. every product, the donuts, coffee, hot chocolate, and breakfast sandwiches are amazing. i am impressed by the quality of the products, not to mention the customer service. if i work here, i can spread joy through a cup of coffee and make customers loyal to the brand. furthermore, the fast paced environment is my ideal workplace.
**what do you know about the company**?
when william rosenberg founded dunkin donuts in 1950, the company first did business in quincy massachusetts. the slogan ""america runs on dunkin"" is accurate. it is the most popular coffee seller in the country, measured by the number of coffee cups sold. dunkin donuts sells over 2 billions cups of coffee in a single calendar year.
**why us and not our competitors**?
as a loyal customer of dunkin donuts, i know that dunkin donuts produces products of much higher quality at a lower price compared to other companies. year after year, dunkin donuts has not dropped in quality at all. the clientele is very diverse and should provide an opportunity to meet new people and learn new things. this restaurant's target demographic is the working class. these are the people who come here to get a coffee and a sausage egg and cheese sandwich right before work. i take great joy in my genuine desire to make life easier or more convenient for the average american.
**why should we hire you**?
my biggest strength and potential contribution to the company would have to be that i am a team player. in a restaurant staff, it is expected that we, as workers, take care of our own and put the needs of the customers first. having majored in behaviour science in undergrad, i have learned how to get along with people and work as a team. when i did community service for sacred heart school in taftville, i would be assigned a task and expected to do it under a time constraint, as the cafeteria was supposed to be used by someone else for something else at an allotted time. therefore, i know how to not only do a good job, but complete a job by a strict deadline. also, i was a student-athlete in high school. from this experience, i built up stamina and learned to multi-task.
**how would you deal with an unsatisfied customer**?
i would offer my condolences, ask why the experience was unpleasant and ask what, if anything, i am capable of doing to remedy the situation so that it never occurs again. if it is possible to fulfil the customer's request while obeying the rules set in place by my employer, i will do so.
**can you work under pressure**?
i can definitely work under pressure. pressure makes me a more competent worker. when i completed an internship in undergrad, the knowledge that i had to complete 100 hours of service by the end of the semester gave me the incentive i needed to reach out to people and ask if there were any favours they needed. when my professor told me that failure to complete 100 hours would result in an f for the course and course credit being withheld, i immediately knew that i needed to reach out and seek opportunities as soon as possible.
**what do you foresee being the biggest challenge at this job**?
i have always wanted to work here and never given much thought to the challenges that are likely to come up. i imagine i will face the typical challenges associated with a fast paced environment. i am sure that it will be nothing unsolvable. when i face a challenge or i am out of my comfort zone, there is no need to talk about how uncomfortable i am. my discomfort is my problem, no one else's. i will deal with the discomfort myself one time. when talking to others i will focus on the positive.
**what would you do if a customer asked to speak to the manager**?
i would first ask what the problem is and whether or not i can help. if i can help, i will. if, however, i lack the ability to solve the problem myself or the customer insists on seeing the manager, then i will get the manager immediately.
**how reliable are you**?
i pride myself in always showing up and time, doing my best and receiving all the constructive criticism that is useful to me. if i am unable to show up, i intend to give my employer and coworkers notice well in advance.
**how do you intend to provide excellent customer service**?
i will always provide service with a smile. in other words, have a positive perky attitude when greeting a customer. i will lead the customer to a seat for an in house order. to ensure that the customer is attended to in a timely manner, i will be sure to sit or stand in a location where i can easily identify a customer and a customer could easily identify me.
**what would you do if you caught a fellow employee stealing from the cash register**?
i do not tolerate unethical behaviour such as stealing. i will report the theft in such a way as standard procedure dictates. this is rarely an issue for me in the first place, as the vast majority of people who i have ever met have proper respect for other people's property.
**how do you achieve proper work-life balance**?
when i am not at work, i throw myself into my hobbies. i enjoy athletic activities like hiking, leisure activities like playing video games and intellectually stimulating activities such as reading classic novels and writing movie reviews.
**what would you do if a customer ordered in house and refused to pay**?
i hope i never have to deal with that, but should such an unfortunate circumstance arise, i would speak to security or management, who are trained to handle such situations.
**what have you done to better your understanding of this field in the last five years**?
in school, i took several classes in psychology and marketing. this taught me a lot about the economy, customer service, human nature and how to behave professionally.
**how would you prioritise tasks during a busy period**?
the customer always comes first.
if i am in the middle of setting a table and a party enters as the phone is ringing, i would drop what i am doing, escort the customer to their table, answer the phone and then finish setting the table in that order.
**how do you intend to blend with our existing team**?
i have pretty good communication and people skills. i respect people's boundaries. if the employee is more experienced than i am, i will look to him or her for guidance
**do you have any questions for me**? (this is what the interviewer will ask).
a year from now, assuming that all goes as planned and i get this job, what will i have to have done to make you glad that you hired me? how will i know if i have done a good job?"

267,1,"Hi Dunkin,

I have a Dunkin’ donuts near my place of work, where I pick up “cold brews” 2-5 times a week. I’m not a huge coffee snob, but I did work at Dunkin in college, and can easily distinguish between cold brew and iced coffee. Dunkin’s iced coffee is much more bitter, more watered down, a slightly lighter color, and leaves bean dust floating in the bottom of your drink. Cold brew, being around a dollar more, is higher quality and tastes better (imo).

So I guess here’s where the snobbiness comes in… I can tell that I often get iced coffee in my “cold brew”, and it quite honestly ruins my day. Some days it’s just straight undrinkable, or full of bean floaties, or an odd grayish color (presumably because it’s watered down remaining iced coffee). I’ve tried clarifying that it is cold brew, I’ve tried asking the cashier if they still have cold brew before I order, I’ve even asked the barista which they used. I have never asked for a remake, and I’m really trying to avoid that, but I will lose my freaking mind if I wind up with another “cold brew” that tastes like coffee piss on ice.

When it comes down to it, if the cashier would honestly tell me that cold brew was out, I simply wouldn’t buy it that day. I’m much more a Starbucks gal, but this dunkin is the sole remaining covid survivor in my area. It’s my only option for coffee I didn’t make myself. I’m not trying to be an asshole, I definitely don’t want to make the employees miserable….. but how on earth can I get them to be honest with me about the contents of the “cold brew”, and is there any way to avoid a weekly gamble? Is it okay to complain? Is it fine to ask for a remake/ refund? I know I hated remaking drinks, but then again, I took the high road and told my customers when I was out of cold brew….

Anyway, friendly reminder to all, customers CAN tell the difference when you sub in the cheaper products. If you’re out of something, please be honest. If you mess up, please correct it. All I want is my cashier to honestly tell me when they’re out of cold brew - that’s it. But instead, I get constant promises that it is indeed cold brew…. and half the time, it’s not.",consistently given iced coffee instead of cold brew?,1661277400,"consistently given iced coffee instead of cold brew? hi dunkin,

415,1,"This is just me ranting, but I'm losing my mind.

When I first started working at Dunkin, I loved it. There were some hiccups, with me not quite being trained properly, but once I learned everything it was awesome. I liked my coworkers, hell I even liked my manager most days. We all worked well as a team and everything, for the most part, ran smoothly. 

But then our manager quit , and they hired a new manager. Although she claims to have prior experience as a Dunkin manager, I swear to god she has no idea what she's doing. Everyone here welcomed her and tried to help her adjust to the store (our store had been renovated recently so we had a few machines that were different to what she was used to), and she was great.. for a few days.

 I had a week off for a vacation soon after she joined, and when I came back everything had gone to hell. I wish I was exaggerating when I say 75% of my coworkers had already quit, without even a 2 weeks notice. From what I heard over text, she wasn't listening to the hours people said they could work and was scheduling people when they weren't at all available, but then getting mad when they said they couldn't come in. A few times, she left a gap in the schedule where NO ONE WAS SCHEDULED TO BE IN THE STORE. The store, left completely unattended, for SEVERAL HOURS. Machines were breaking because she refused to learn how to use them properly. She'd come on the floor to ""help"", make a mess, and then leave and expect everyone else to clean it up. And in my experience since I've come back, it's all true. I've specifically said I cannot, under any circumstances, work opening shifts. Last week she scheduled me for exclusively opening. I texted her, AGAIN, to tell her I couldn't, and she told me I had to ""figure it out and find someone to cover."" I switched with a girl who said she couldn't do closing shifts and only got closing shifts. 

Now that we're constantly understaffed, we're all just trying our best and, yes, we're taking shortcuts. Shoot me, sometimes I'll make a latte right in the cup instead of putting it in the metal tin first. Or I'll bounce between stations instead of sticking to one because we don't have enough people to staff every station! And when I'm closing I have to leave my coworker out on the floor by herself to go to the back to do closing chores because we don't have anyone else to help. But she is constantly nitpicking everything and saying it's ""not standard!!"" but it's literally the only way we can get through the day anymore.

I came in yesterday, and said Hello to her on my way in. Without even saying hello or good morning or anything, the first thing she said to me, at 6 in the fucking morning, was ""Why did it take you more than 10 minutes to do boxes yesterday?"" It was truck day, I had literally an entire stores worth of supplies that we had unpacked from boxes, and ALL of those boxes had to be broken down. Anyone who works at Dunkin knows that is DOZENS of boxes, and most of them are too big to fit in the dumpster at all so they have to be cut and well broke down before they can be taken out. And that's not including the 2 minutes each way it takes to pull the trashcan to the dumpster, and you usually need at least 2-3 trips (if not more). And I told her all of this, and she said she didn't care, and that next time she caught me ""wasting time"" she'd suspend me.

The only thing keeping me here at this point is that almost no one in the area is hiring, and the very few people that are hiring are hiring for jobs that I am so not qualified for. But I swear I've never felt more mentally drained.",thinking about quitting,1660535299,"thinking about quitting this is just me ranting, but i'm losing my mind.

Baskin Robbins has a core set of flavors that we must keep at all times, and a rotating monthly array of the other ones determined by both Dunkin brands and the franchisee. This is also true for toppings, LTOs and niche items such as mangonadas. 


**Doordash does not recognize that the flavors change and will show all of them as available!**


As such, when the order comes in, we must wait for the driver to come by, let them know the missing items and hope that the customer answers their phone. If they can't answer the phone, the driver cancels and another is sent over and over until either the customer picks up their phone, we decide to substitute something similar and write a note, or the customer cancels on their end.

421,1,"Been working at Dunkin for about 3 weeks now and I don't know if I should keep working here, they put us in this groupchat and the manager keeps complaining about things not being done all the time. She also doesn't want us to lock the doors at night, but the neighborhood the Dunkin is in is so sketchy. I see why my coworkers were locking it. I don't know how to make any of the drinks just refreshers and iced coffee. It feels like some of the people around me, especially the managers don't have patience with me. I close with one manager all the time and sometimes I ask him stuff, he doesn't respond. Like can he hear me or is he just ignoring me? Also when I first started working there, they told me they only had morning shift from 5am- 4pm and 1pm-9pm.

Then I go to make a drink and notice is that the sticker machine is printing the writing HUGE, so only the first few letters of each ingredient are being shown on the sticker. Ex. 1 cre, 2 fre, 4 su instead of 1 cream, 2 French vanilla, 4 sugars. And for frozens it would just say ""(size) frozen"" and we couldn't tell if it was a frozen coffee or frozen hot chocolate. So I had to keep looking on the screen to try and identify what I was making. 


After figuring out what the first drink was I went to put cream in it, only for the dispenser not to shoot anything out (despite at least half full.) I try to use the other machine, same issue. I manually open tiny creamer packets, pour them in, and tell my manager so she knows it's broken.


Next I fill a blender to make a frozen, and pass it off to beverage three for them to blend it. I hear them freaking out, look over, and the machine wouldn't stop dispensing ice. It was supposed to make a small coolata but it has completely filled the blender with ice and was still trying to dispense more. We had to shut down the machine and couldn't do frozens again for the rest of the day.


I got swapped to drivethrough later in the day, and noticed that our drivethrough window wasn't automatically shutting like it was supposed to. This would've been fine, seeing as there wasn't AC or anything so it's not like it could get any hotter, except it was rainy and the wind was blowing all the rain into the store. Had to keep manually pushing/pulling on the window to get it to close and open.


Not only was the rain getting in the store, but it was raining so hard that I was practically screaming into my headset and the people in the drivethrough couldn't hear me still! And then they'd get upset that I wasn't taking their order even though I was trying to, And I had to explain at the window that it was just because of the rain.

According to the paper (which I forgot to snap a pic of!) all of the Southern California Dunkin’s are going to be the first Dunkin’s in the country to transition from DD Perks to Dunkin Rewards. The transition will happen later this month or next month. 

I saw a post posted yesterday or the day before talking about this change. If you want more information on the transition check out that post, however to summarize the change, more rewards than just a free drink like sandwiches, donuts and more! Only downside is the good drinks are all obtainable by acquiring 500+ points making it harder to get to the free drink reward..

592,1,"My mother can be a bit much sometimes, honestly I don’t even know why she bothered to order just a black coffee, but we don’t have a coffee maker right now so I can’t shame her on that too much. She likes to claim allergies because she read the “How to Karen” handbook that says apparently claiming allergies will get it absolutely removed, but even still…. I guess I should start at the beginning.

We went to Dunkin today because I wanted a coffee since I’ve been up since 5am due to a new medication schedule that ain’t working for me. We go in because the line in the drive through was a bit long. I ordered my usual(butter pecan with oat milk iced latte), my stepfathers cappuccino blast because ours is the fancy Baskin Robins conjoined twin, and my mother wants a “Black coffee ice blended thingy” Me trying to translate “Just a blended black coffee”, she asks for no dairy or sugar of any kind because she is on a “diet”(and thinks she’s better than us for it), now I don’t care about her ordering it without dairy or sugar or anything because if she wants to drink her bitter burnt coffee beans I’m not going to stop her.
I redeem my free beverage for my drink because why not. We are waiting for our drinks, mine and my stepfathers are finished first, and now we’re waiting on my mothers. The girl comes over and asks if my mother wants whipped cream, I understand why, some people ask for no dairy or dairy alternatives but still get whipped cream but my mother gets the Karen hair up her ass and freaks out “I said no cream! I only wanted a frozen blended black coffee!” Despite the fact she knows that I get panic attacks over any person getting outrageously upset, I manage to hold together despite wanting to gag my mother with the dish towel.
Well, for some reason the girl becomes very upset over this and cops an attitude. Like I can understand my mothers attitude not being the best, not by a very far margin, but the girl began acting like my mother had held her down and called her names.
“Well you ordered a cappuccino blast.” The girl first goes “That’s my husbands yes, I am ALLERGIC to dairy!!” (Honestly not sure if she’s allergic or lactose intolerant like me, she claims she had some joint pain and felt swollen and bloated the last time she had some dairy). I explain my mother just wanted a black coffee blended up with ice, while my mother is freaking out and going “I just wanted a black coffee with ice!”(Leaving off the blended part entirely which probably is what spurs this next part), while one girl is going “I’m going to fix this for you ma’am.” The girl comes over and SLAMS down a cup of just black ice coffee in front of my mother and walks off. While another girl is explaining that if my mother wanted it blended, it had to be done with dairy or cream in it which honestly doesn’t even sound right to me, but I don’t work there so whatever. As we are leaving the girl calls “Have a good day ma’am!” After my mother as I am trying to herd her out the door.

597,1,"To put it shortly, I was working for a few days during training time, then was put on a 2 day schedule to work 6 hours, then later given 1 day a week of work for 5 to 12, with some days being 6 to 12 and 7 to 12. Then this past month, my boss called and transferred me over to another Dunkin but gave me more hours to work. I worked four days from 5 to 12 under a new manager. But after one week with that crew, the manager realized that she had too many people working on the same shift and needed to send some back. So, she sent me back but didn't tell me even though she said she would give me an update Friday. I found out Sunday of by the district manager that I was sent back and I would get a call from my old manager about the days they will want me to work. 

I got no calls that whole week. I left a message the following Monday and got an answer back on Tuesday that they're putting me on Mondays but are trying to decide what time. I didn't hear anything else the whole week until today that I'm getting Mondays but working only four hours. I might come in this coming Monday but the scheduling has made me consider quitting, maybe after working that Monday. Because it feels like a waste of time. They might be oversaturated with workers since it's the summer and this is popular place to get a summer job, and I don't want to deal with high-stress for that low a pay. Not again.

I don't know if this is the right move yet because, while I'm not desperate, and I just mostly wanted answers when I called last week to see what was going on, I don't know if it would be the best move to abruptly quit after being given some work hours. I'm of course searching and applying to other jobs but I haven't heard back from any HR reps yet.

694,1,"hey, y'all..

this is my first time posting on this subreddit.

anyway, I started working at my very close Dunkins for the past month and a few weeks, and it has been alright. I do overnights and it's just Drive-Thru only until the front doors are unlocked. The plus side is the pay rate and my awesome co-worker. But once 4 AM rolls around, these three guys punch in and are there for the early morning shift. One is a baker, the other is always at sandwich station as the other is there to just open the front doors for Eat In and does the necessary morning shift stuff like temperature records, etc. 

So, I've noticed it is just me (a female) working overnight with my co-worker who's a dude. majority of this Dunks are all men besides my manager and two-morning shift workers. We are always together doing the work and I refuse to leave my ""space"" on the drive-thru area because these early morning shift guys (the 4 AM crew) give me an uncomfortable vibe and I hate the way each of them stares at me when I'm just trying to do my job and I have caught each of them staring at me in a weird way especially when I'm bending over to reach something from the ground level. Almost three weeks ago, the guy who is responsible for being on the front counter and opening up, said to me ""maybe I can help you get better sleep"" with a wink after I complained that I will be tired when I get home and even if I try to sleep, I have two kids under the age of 6 who need my care. When he said that, I felt disgusted and gave him a glare and told him that wasn't cool which he laughed off. Then a week ago and this week, he purposely tried bumping into me so he can feel my ass while I'm making coffee orders in the drive-thru (he's a big average guy but c'mon, there's still space between us but he makes it seem like its cramped). My co-worker has been observant of this behavior ad has told both my manager and me about it and he hates it because all I'm trying to do is my job and I'm already in a committed relationship with kids. My manager has reported these guys and they each have a history of making other (ex) female employees uncomfortable that they either transferred out of the store or quit. My manager has also spoken to this guy but he's back at it with his lewd comments and giving me that off creep vibes. Yesterday after leaving, my co-worker stayed behind to count his register and he heard these guys (including the cleaner and other male crew members) talking about how ""f\*\*\*able"" I look, how my ass looks, etc) and my co-worker snapped at them by \*again\* telling them that I'm 27 and happily taken, and to stop talking about me like that.

I'm disgusted, repulsed, and don't feel comfortable showing up to work in this kind of environment and I'm sure anyone else will agree. I have vented to my husband about these issues and it has made him very pissed off that before I was ready to clock out this past Sunday, he came to pick me up but went straight to the front counter to ask for my manager and she was there and can see how pissed he was and is aware of the situation that she asked him to follow her to her office and talk to him about this and showed him her reports she has made against these guys. All my manager can say is that if I want, I can call HR/Corporate directly and just make a complaint or threaten them with a harassment lawsuit because she has made numerous complaints and all these guys get is a ""slap on the wrist"" and my manager's boss has already made it clear that they don't want to fire anyone because the Dunks I work at is very short-staffed already..

this is my first time posting on this subreddit.
anyway, i started working at my very close dunkins for the past month and a few weeks, and it has been alright. i do overnights and it's just drive-thru only until the front doors are unlocked. the plus side is the pay rate and my awesome co-worker. but once 4 am rolls around, these three guys punch in and are there for the early morning shift. one is a baker, the other is always at sandwich station as the other is there to just open the front doors for eat in and does the necessary morning shift stuff like temperature records, etc.
so, i've noticed it is just me (a female) working overnight with my co-worker who's a dude. majority of this dunks are all men besides my manager and two-morning shift workers. we are always together doing the work and i refuse to leave my ""space"" on the drive-thru area because these early morning shift guys (the 4 am crew) give me an uncomfortable vibe and i hate the way each of them stares at me when i'm just trying to do my job and i have caught each of them staring at me in a weird way especially when i'm bending over to reach something from the ground level. almost three weeks ago, the guy who is responsible for being on the front counter and opening up, said to me ""maybe i can help you get better sleep"" with a wink after i complained that i will be tired when i get home and even if i try to sleep, i have two kids under the age of 6 who need my care. when he said that, i felt disgusted and gave him a glare and told him that wasn't cool which he laughed off. then a week ago and this week, he purposely tried bumping into me so he can feel my ass while i'm making coffee orders in the drive-thru (he's a big average guy but c'mon, there's still space between us but he makes it seem like its cramped). my co-worker has been observant of this behavior ad has told both my manager and me about it and he hates it because all i'm trying to do is my job and i'm already in a committed relationship with kids. my manager has reported these guys and they each have a history of making other (ex) female employees uncomfortable that they either transferred out of the store or quit. my manager has also spoken to this guy but he's back at it with his lewd comments and giving me that off creep vibes. yesterday after leaving, my co-worker stayed behind to count his register and he heard these guys (including the cleaner and other male crew members) talking about how ""f\*\*\*able"" i look, how my ass looks, etc) and my co-worker snapped at them by \*again\* telling them that i'm 27 and happily taken, and to stop talking about me like that.
they all laughed at him and kept on with their conversation.

739,1,"I have to share this with someone because this one customer we always get is.. interesting to say the least.

Apparently she's a regular, but because of my schedule I've never seen her before. However, my availability changed so Ive been working earlier hours, meaning I've started to encounter her.

My first time meeting her was today when I was working drive through. It wasn't super busy and she walked up (yes, walked) to our drivethrough speaker asking for a free water. I said okay, because it's just water and it was a super hot day, and called out to my coworker asking for a medium water. (My stores policy is that we can give away mediums or smalls for free, but larges have to be paid for.) She walks up to the window and I told her like Hey, it's really dangerous to be walking in a drivethrough and could you please just come inside? Our lobby was open, and I was kinda worried a car would pull through and wouldn't see her (our drivethrough has a weird blind spot, which she was standing right in the middle of). She said no and that she needed her water, so I went to go get it quickly before she got hurt. I brought it out to her and told her to have a good day, before walking away from the window to go do something else.

A few seconds later I hear pounding on our drivethrough window. I go back over and she's slamming her fists on the glass, screaming that she wanted a large. I apologized, told her I wasn't allowed to give away larges for free. She reached in my window to dump the medium onto the floor and said ""No, a large."" I went to get my supervisor and hep was just like ""Oh, yeah it's her, just give it to her."" I was just in shock. Gave her a large and she went from hysterical to happy in seconds. Walked back up the drivethrough (towards the speaker, not the exit??) giggling and drinking her water. She yelled ""THANK YOU!"" at the speaker and walked away.

I still don't know how to feel about it to be honest. Everyone else at work has seemingly just accepted it but I'm just like.. why do we let her get away with this? I feel like at the very least someone should call someone for her cause I feel like with the way she's acting she needs help, genuinely.",crazy customer,1658204101,"crazy customer i have to share this with someone because this one customer we always get is.. interesting to say the least.

(my stores policy is that we can give away mediums or smalls for free, but larges have to be paid for.) she walks up to the window and i told her like hey, it's really dangerous to be walking in a drivethrough and could you please just come inside? our lobby was open, and i was kinda worried a car would pull through and wouldn't see her (our drivethrough has a weird blind spot, which she was standing right in the middle of). she said no and that she needed her water, so i went to go get it quickly before she got hurt. i brought it out to her and told her to have a good day, before walking away from the window to go do something else.
a few seconds later i hear pounding on our drivethrough window. i go back over and she's slamming her fists on the glass, screaming that she wanted a large. i apologized, told her i wasn't allowed to give away larges for free. she reached in my window to dump the medium onto the floor and said ""no, a large."" i went to get my supervisor and hep was just like ""oh, yeah it's her, just give it to her."" i was just in shock. gave her a large and she went from hysterical to happy in seconds. walked back up the drivethrough (towards the speaker, not the exit??) giggling and drinking her water. she yelled ""thank you!"" at the speaker and walked away.
i still don't know how to feel about it to be honest. everyone else at work has seemingly just accepted it but i'm just like.. why do we let her get away with this? i feel like at the very least someone should call someone for her cause i feel like with the way she's acting she needs help, genuinely."

Because I order from many different Dunkin locations, I’m assuming this is the official cooking procedure (I’m guessing to meet order time quotas, or some other corporate agenda… because otherwise, a single-sided grilled cheese sandwich is not fathomable). 

I tried to ask in the drive through to cook both sides, and the girl said “okay, so you want it ‘extra toasty’”. I thought that was Dunkin lingo, so I started ordering them that way, “I’ll have a grilled cheese sandwich, extra toasty” (I felt foolish saying it every time).  The results were hit or miss; so, I figured “extra toasty” isn’t actually a Dunkin term… the girl just said that.

So, I went back requesting them to “toast the sandwich on both sides, please”.  It’s still a roll of the dice.

\- they order 'well done hash browns' as if it's a steak or something. I actually laughed when someone ordered and asked them what they meant, dude says, just put the hash browns in the oven for 2 rotations. I highly doubt that's what he really wanted.  

\- ""let me get a small black iced coffee with 2 shots of x, 2 sugar, and some caramel"" 

\- I had a guy order a black hot coffee with 3 creams, NO SUGAR. gave it to him, he complained it had 3 creams. Same guy proceeds to order again, 2 frozen medium coffees. Give him the first one, buddy loses it and screams that he wanted a small. I told him ok i'll give him a small even though he paid for mediums. 

\- I had someone order 3 sandwhiches, then goes to wait, next person ordered a small coffee and a glaze stick. I give him it. First customer comes over and starts getting in my face about someone else getting served first. I said he didn't order hot food, the customer goes ""well he has the same bag"", I was actually dumbfounded at how stupid you gotta be to say that and think that that is how things work.

\- People really think as I'm making someone's coffee they can order by yelling at me their order. I usually just ignore these tards.

\- People that wait in line and come up to you and go ""i ordered on the app"", like okay.

\- People that come in complain we don't have their mobile order and then I look at their app and tell them they ordered to a different dunkins. Very satisfying especially when they're all worked up over 'our' error. 

\- had a guy scream at me for a blueberry donut, I said I'm too new here to understand where they might be and he points to the cornbread donuts and asks for that one. Not sure if he was happy with the result.

\- Had another guy scream at me after I asked him to confirm he wanted 2 coconut donuts.

\- Had a crazy ass lady that spent her whole day sitting in the dunks ask for the dragonfruit refresher in a cup and ask if it would be free. Like, what.

\- Have multiple idiots that think the tip jar is a 'take a penny' type deal. It's not.

\- People who don't move out of the way after they order when there is a line.

\- Had a dude scream at me ""WHEN AM I GONNA GET MY COFFEE I BEEN WAITIN HERE FOR 5 MINUTES"" during a rush. we are 2 people working, ive been there at that point a week probably.

\- Had another dude get his croissant wrong it was chocolate not plain and he lost his mind and walked out yelling FUCK THIS instead of waiting for a plain one to be heated, literally does not take even a minute. 

\- People that are rude / yell at you then come back in and pretend it never happened, naw ur service is gonna be slow as hell and I'm going to be rude back to you. 

\- some of these peoples coffee orders are legitimately disgusting and sometimes half the cup is full of flavoring shit, like u see the posts on here all the time about nasty coffee orders, it's true and a good chunk of the time it's ordered on ubereats/grubhub/doordash.

831,1,"here are some things i’ve noticed that bug workers and customers alike 

1) if you are ordering a dozen donuts and you want to pick them out dear god do NOT do it through the drive thru. come in. also donuts typically sell out by 1pm so if you come at 5 and ask for a dozen you will probably be let down.

2) if you want cream or sugar please say that. if you want a specific amount, tell the person. so many times people assume the employees just know their order and know how they take their coffee and then get mad when it doesn’t come out the way they wanted. also- we don’t mind re making drinks at all.

3) if you say you want a medium black coffee with caramel in it- then it’s no longer a black coffee because the swirls have milk built in. 

4) if you place your mobile order a minute before you come it won’t be ready. and if you place it and come thru an hour later everything will be melted. my best advice is to place it before leaving your house so it will be ready when you come.

5) if you have two separate orders please tell the person at the window instead of just starting at them and not leaving the drive thru. sometimes it’s so busy the order taker doesn’t have time to notify the cashier that someone has two separate orders and people will just sit in their cars looking into space for 5 minutes instead of telling you they had a second order. 

6) if you pay in all change i will personally take 10 minutes to count it and hand your food out, i get if it was a $2 bill but if you give me $8 worth of dimes and nickels and are rude about it (most times) then i will take my sweet old time doing it. 

7) MOST IMPORTANT- we are just people like you we are just doing our jobs and it’s just coffee. if it is wrong, ask nicely and it will be remade. so many people treat food workers as personal servants and get mad when they aren’t catered to during a rush where everyone is doing 5 things at once. be patient and nice and appreciate that it’s just coffee and mess ups can be fixed :) i can tell you that the regular customers we are rude are very well known and all the employees know who is rude and who isn’t before they even come up to the window. and the regular customers who are sweet bulls relationships and we are happy to see them!",tips for customers,1657542336,"tips for customers here are some things i've noticed that bug workers and customers alike
1) if you are ordering a dozen donuts and you want to pick them out dear god do not do it through the drive thru. come in. also donuts typically sell out by 1pm so if you come at 5 and ask for a dozen you will probably be let down.
2) if you want cream or sugar please say that. if you want a specific amount, tell the person. so many times people assume the employees just know their order and know how they take their coffee and then get mad when it doesn't come out the way they wanted. also- we don't mind re making drinks at all.
3) if you say you want a medium black coffee with caramel in it- then it's no longer a black coffee because the swirls have milk built in.
4) if you place your mobile order a minute before you come it won't be ready. and if you place it and come thru an hour later everything will be melted. my best advice is to place it before leaving your house so it will be ready when you come.
5) if you have two separate orders please tell the person at the window instead of just starting at them and not leaving the drive thru. sometimes it's so busy the order taker doesn't have time to notify the cashier that someone has two separate orders and people will just sit in their cars looking into space for 5 minutes instead of telling you they had a second order.

I went to dunks last week and had the worst experience. I have never complained but I wish I had in this case. 
Pulled into the drive thru, dunks was empty. Sat at the mic for 12 minutes until someone finally spoke up. Teens were laughing and goofing off, but I really just needed a coffee so I stayed. Ordered a small black iced coffee with sugar and avocado toast. 
Pulled to the window and couldn’t see anyone in there. Sat around for 10 minutes before I almost left and finally a woman came by. She looked cooked out of her mind and asked me again what I had ordered. I repeated my order twice to her and she repeated it back to me and charged me. She then handed me a medium hot coffee with XX, and I swear someone had already drank from it because there was pink lipgloss on the cap… 
Annoyed I just explained my order again and she apologized. 
I see her goofing off with some guy through the window, and I waited for another 10 minutes. I got so annoyed I knocked on the window. Pissed this time I just kindly asked for my coffee and food. She then handed me a wet bag and a small iced coffee with some type of swirl in it. I wound up leaving rather then complaining. 
Got home and the avocado toast wasn’t out in the regular box, it was wrapped in a napkin, soggy wet, with brown avocado spread… 
I wish I had the courage to complain, but honestly the employees gave me such an off putting vibe I didn’t want to put up with them. I’m debating writing in anonymously to the manager because now that I have shared my experiences my siblings and friends also had bad experiences with those two as well.

I had a really weird experience happen today and wanted to share with you guys. Today I got a cookies and cream milkshake, and the workers took a really long time. I did not mind as I wasn’t in a hurry, and there were no other cars Infront of me or behind me. When I received my drink, it was very watery and not at all like the previous milkshakes I have had. I did not want to be a “Karen” so I drove off and took a sip, but it had no flavor and was definitely not like any of the previous milkshakes I have had. Due to this, I decided to turn around and take it back to the store to ask if he could maybe remake it. I was really nice and asked him if he could remake it, and the worker replied with “the drink is perfectly fine, if I remake it it’s just going to be the same way, so idk what to tell you.” I was perplexed, I have never received a response like this at any establishment, so I just asked for a refund. The worker then said I don’t know how to do refunds so just come back another day. 

This was such an odd experience, and the Dunkin Donuts I went to has had some recent problems, with many of my friends complaining that since they switch employees so often, the employees are new and sometimes mess up the drinks.

1143,1,"Hiya. 
Some info- I live in a small town in New England. Dunkins quite popular. Husband works at various job sites and frequents a dunkin location 2-3 times a week, goes to other locations the other days. 
I place his mobile orders for him through the app every time he needs it which is often. 
I am placing these orders 10-15 minutes before he arrives at the locations. Why? Because the food part of the order is only ready half of the time. So we figure give them lots of extra time to have it done. But it happened again this morning. I placed the order at 6:45AM, husband walked in at 7AM. Drink is ready, food isnt. 
Weve never been offered refunds, never even really complained to the workers because we arent the confrontational kind. At this point Im just irritated for my husband. He doesnt have time to get in line and wait after finding out his food isnt ready for 10 mins. Hence why we use mobile ordering in the first place. So he can walk in, get his stuff, walk out. For months they just...never gave him the donuts he ordered. Now its whatever food he gets. The drinks the only thing present. 
I wish I had a record of how often this happens. It sounds ridiculous but we've been doing this for over a year, and i want to say at least 30-40% of the time he walks out without breakfast and is upset, to say the least. 
I called customer support this morning.. Guy says he will bring this up to the specific stores owners/managers and have them call me. Not looking forward to that as its a small town where everybody knows everybody.. This has the potential to get uncomfortable. But we are pretty fed up after so many repeats of this.","mobile orders only ever half ready, really irked.",1655293915,"mobile orders only ever half ready, really irked. hiya.

1177,1,"Okay, so this has been bugging me for the past few hours ever since I ended my shift today at work. So, I work at the local Dunkin's in my town and the day was mostly good. One of my better workdays even. I'm new and have only been there for a month and a half by now. Today, during one of the last hours of my shift, I was trying to fix the donut case. It was almost noon and there were two empty spaces at the top that I wanted to fill with two single trays of donuts that were at the bottom so I could cover the last shelf with the blinds once it was empty. 

This girl who I just met last week starts coming over while I am thinking about putting them next to the big trays of donuts and is like ""You probably can just leave the space empty because I'm going to move the muffins over there."" Now the muffins are perfectly placed at the top and usually sitting there in the other case because they're supposed to be. Not to mention there is a full single tray of each muffin next to each other. The second case was looking nice. There were cases with single donuts, and I would gladly move them to a different tray that has space, but sometimes the manager tells me to leave them in their own tray, so we don't confuse the customers. Plus there were plenty of donuts in other trays, and spaces between the trays at the top that needed to be filled and they would perfectly be there, if I just placed some in the middle at the top and fill any empty spaces with some donut trays at the bottom, like my supervisor usually tells me to do. 

I don't know if this girl is returning employee or new, she might have been the former, but I was a little confused when she told me that she was going to transfer the muffins there. I mean, I've seen other co-workers just do what I was initially going to do. When I told her what I was about to do, she was like ""I'm just telling you this because I'm closing and am going to put the muffins over on this case instead"". I told her I was just putting some on there for now so there wouldn't be empty gaps because I know our boss doesn't like that, and I placed a tray of Boston Kreme at the top to fill a gap. She just said ""Okay, you can do that for now,"" but then I saw her walk over to two of our other co-workers who were just standing there by drive-thru looking at us, and she looks like she was saying something to them, and then the other co-worker she was talking to said ""Yeah, that's how everyone else feels,"" while she was looking right at me. And I was like ""Are they talking about me?"" 

Like, what does ""everyone \[supposedly\] feel""? Because I wasn't trying to be a jerk or know-it-all. I know I'm new I was just trying to follow what I was usually told, especially since I had tried to put different pastries on certain trays and told to ""keep some in their own trays instead and focus on filling the gaps"". Plus, I still had chores to finish before my shift ends and fixing the donut case is one of them, so I didn't want to just stand there and do nothing. I immediately asked  the other two co-workers if I had made a mistake and explained what I was trying to do. They told me  that they might move stuff over soon, so I was like ""Okay"". 

I then told the girl that I'm just ""leaving some trays up there to fill in the gaps for now"" because I didn't want to leave the case looking incomplete like that. Then she was like ""Okay, it's just that I have a certain way of doing things when organizing the cases."" And I was like ""Okay, I understand."" I was like, 'alright, I'll leave it to her. She probably is just a returning employee and have done this many times already. It's whatever. My only issue is that fact that it seems like she was talking about me or what I was doing to the other co-workers and one of them was making a passive-aggressive comment while looking in my direction. I didn't know exactly what the girl whispered to her, but with what she did immediately after what I said I was trying to do, it seems like this is what happened. 

You could easily guess what the subject of their mini-chat was about at that point. And I'm thinking ""Okay. I'm not trying to step on anyone's toes. I'm just trying to do my job. If this girl has something to say, she can say it to my face instead of being a fake b\*tch and trying to say something behind my back as if I wouldn't notice. As for the other co-worker, she's said some mild condescending shit before (did on my second day of work, if you remember my post about that), but she's usually upfront with me on some stuff if I've made a mistake. I don't need that passive-aggressive nonsense just because I wanted to just fill the remaining gaps on a donut case. You know? Like, I don't have time for that toxic BS. It's rude and petty. Like, if I was making a mistake here by not letting her do it before my shift ends or something, my bad, but it does not warrant that behavior. Not to mention the fact that they seemed a bit standoffish when I was clocking out for work annoyed me, too. Like, it's not that deep.

i don't know if this girl is returning employee or new, she might have been the former, but i was a little confused when she told me that she was going to transfer the muffins there. i mean, i've seen other co-workers just do what i was initially going to do. when i told her what i was about to do, she was like ""i'm just telling you this because i'm closing and am going to put the muffins over on this case instead"". i told her i was just putting some on there for now so there wouldn't be empty gaps because i know our boss doesn't like that, and i placed a tray of boston kreme at the top to fill a gap. she just said ""okay, you can do that for now,"" but then i saw her walk over to two of our other co-workers who were just standing there by drive-thru looking at us, and she looks like she was saying something to them, and then the other co-worker she was talking to said ""yeah, that's how everyone else feels,"" while she was looking right at me. and i was like ""are they talking about me?""
like, what does ""everyone \[supposedly\] feel""? because i wasn't trying to be a jerk or know-it-all. i know i'm new i was just trying to follow what i was usually told, especially since i had tried to put different pastries on certain trays and told to ""keep some in their own trays instead and focus on filling the gaps"". plus, i still had chores to finish before my shift ends and fixing the donut case is one of them, so i didn't want to just stand there and do nothing. i immediately asked the other two co-workers if i had made a mistake and explained what i was trying to do. they told me that they might move stuff over soon, so i was like ""okay"".
i then told the girl that i'm just ""leaving some trays up there to fill in the gaps for now"" because i didn't want to leave the case looking incomplete like that. then she was like ""okay, it's just that i have a certain way of doing things when organizing the cases."" and i was like ""okay, i understand."" i was like, 'alright, i'll leave it to her. she probably is just a returning employee and have done this many times already. it's whatever. my only issue is that fact that it seems like she was talking about me or what i was doing to the other co-workers and one of them was making a passive-aggressive comment while looking in my direction. i didn't know exactly what the girl whispered to her, but with what she did immediately after what i said i was trying to do, it seems like this is what happened.
you could easily guess what the subject of their mini-chat was about at that point. and i'm thinking ""okay. i'm not trying to step on anyone's toes. i'm just trying to do my job. if this girl has something to say, she can say it to my face instead of being a fake b\*tch and trying to say something behind my back as if i wouldn't notice. as for the other co-worker, she's said some mild condescending shit before (did on my second day of work, if you remember my post about that), but she's usually upfront with me on some stuff if i've made a mistake. i don't need that passive-aggressive nonsense just because i wanted to just fill the remaining gaps on a donut case. you know? like, i don't have time for that toxic bs. it's rude and petty. like, if i was making a mistake here by not letting her do it before my shift ends or something, my bad, but it does not warrant that behavior. not to mention the fact that they seemed a bit standoffish when i was clocking out for work annoyed me, too. like, it's not that deep. have any of you ever dealt with something like this months within your start at dunkin' donuts?"

1252,1,"I had a weird experience yesterday and thought I’d get your thoughts. I went to a different store than I usually do and ordered my usual—a large decaf iced coffee. The order went through in the app but when I went to pick it up they told me they can’t make any iced espresso or coffee drinks decaf. Is this typical?

Given how the decaf iced coffee usually tastes, I assumed they just poured hot coffee over ice to make it. Is that how it’s done? Or does it need to be prepared specially, which most stores won’t bother to do for decaf?

I like my iced decaf coffee (can’t have regular) but I don’t want to keep ordering it different places if it’s not typically available, even if it appears to be on the app. Thanks!",decaf iced coffee,1654352767,"decaf iced coffee i had a weird experience yesterday and thought i'd get your thoughts. i went to a different store than i usually do and ordered my usual--a large decaf iced coffee. the order went through in the app but when i went to pick it up they told me they can't make any iced espresso or coffee drinks decaf. is this typical?

However I’ve only been able to find it a non-local DD which of course I always happen to visit when I’m in the area. The salted caramel syrup mixed with SC cold foam and topped with cinnamon sugar is quite delightful.

1462,1,"So I got a new job a while ago that is right next to a Dunkin, which I was very excited about.

However I've been on a diet that's more or less incredibly low / zero sugar.

While it was cold, all I got were Cappuccinos with a single sugar. Which was probably too much, but too bitter for me.

Anyways, now that it's hot as hell all the time, I need an iced drink.

I got a good macchiato that I liked but didn't realize how much sugar it actually had in it.

however i've been on a diet that's more or less incredibly low / zero sugar.
while it was cold, all i got were cappuccinos with a single sugar. which was probably too much, but too bitter for me.
anyways, now that it's hot as hell all the time, i need an iced drink.
i got a good macchiato that i liked but didn't realize how much sugar it actually had in it.

I order through the app, is this possible that they are seeing and reading the ticket wrong so consistently? Or am I just going insane. Also, I’ve noticed that when I order the same drink from other Dunkins, it is sometimes darker. I notice a lot of inconsistencies with how drinks are made at different dunkins.

I got to work at around 3:25PM after having a panic attack over missing part of my uniform and overall having a bad day AND being late. I clock in, put my stuff away and go to the front. 

there’s a lady standing at the donut racks looking irritated, she looked at me and and said “we’ll are you going to help me?” and i politely said “sure if you come over to the cash register i can get your order started” 

she comes over and starts her order, 18 munchkins and 2 custard filled donuts. After confirming with my co worker, i tell her we don’t have any more. She IMMEDIATELY cops an attitude, saying how ridiculous it is we don’t have donuts. I just kind of sit there until she decided on a new donut, she wanted Bismarck, again, we’re out of that. At that point she throws her hands down and says “fine i don’t want any of it. i want a refund.” so i put the munchkins and donuts away. 

i’ve never done a refund before, ever, so i try to ask one of the older girls, who tells me to text the manager. I text the manger who, is no help. So i figure it out myself after sitting there for 20 mins trying to figure it out, about half way through she asked to speak to a manager and my manager wasn’t there and she responded with “so they’re having people who are useless and worthless at their job working with out a manager? wow” at this point im trying not to cry, im shaking violently, i haven’t eaten or drank at all at this point, im tired and not having a good day. 

I sit there and i don’t say anything and i figure it out and accidentally refunded for 14 munchkins and the two donuts instead of 18 munchkins so literally $1.05 was missing. She, once again, called me useless at my job and she wanted the managers number who was ignoring me now. She was yelling at me and i genuinely thought it was the system because i double checked and thought everything was okay, luckily at this point my managers boss came in and helped her, the lady switched her attitude with her and wasn’t rude at all while i was sitting there trying not to break down sobbing in the middle of the lobby. 

Once my managers boss left i immediately went to the freezer and sobbed for a good 5 minutes. Luckily i had awesome customers the rest of the day :)

I hate seeing articles like this because it really just shows that people don't understand how menus work. You can get any flavor in a coffee. A caramel cold brew is not a different menu item from a normal cold brew. That's why they separate the flavors from the drinks on the menu.

What makes it even worse is stuff like the final entry ""caramel cold foam cold brew,"" where they say they don't know if it's the same caramel that goes in the foam as that which goes in the drink. Like, no, the foam comes from a can and the caramel swirl is a syrup.

1624,1,"Oh boy what an absolute shit show this was. I went to the dunkin closest to my gym after a workout. And this location is always hit or miss so I should have known better.

I ordered a ""medium iced cake batter latte with whole milk""

They gave me a medium iced *coffee* (cake batter) with oat milk. Okay no problem, people make mistakes. Another barista remade it.

Except this time she put a large iced cake batter signature latte on the counter. I asked whose it was. I thought maybe someone else ordered a cake batter signature latte *because I sure as hell didn't*. The barista said, ""this is what you ordered"". I said no I didn't. 

She upgraded me to a large signature because of their earlier mistake, which is my guess. Which is fine. But I don't want a 700-million calorie bomb with the whipped cream nasty mocha drizzle sprinkle bullshit on top. Ugh. I just wanted a basic bitch iced latte with 3 cake batter swirls. Why is that so hard? 

Anyway, I didn't ask them to remake it, said thank you and walked away. I think if you're going to upgrade someone's drink, ask them first: ""Would you like me to upgrade your drink to a large signature as a courtesy?"" 

Taste test: initial sip I get a massive sugar alcohol taste. It reminds me of old-school starbucks french vanilla Frappuccino's. I honestly don't taste cake batter. Just tastes like heavy french vanilla+alcohol. It's not the worst swirl I've tried. But I can't say that I am a fan. I definitely prefer the butter pecan now that I've tried both. With butter pecan I can still taste the espresso. Whereas with this one I don't taste coffee at all. It just tastes like sugar alcohol. So yeah, looks like this is a dud for me and I probably won't buy it again. #BringBackSaltedCaramel",my review of the cake batter signature latte,1651419516,"my review of the cake batter signature latte oh boy what an absolute shit show this was. i went to the dunkin closest to my gym after a workout. and this location is always hit or miss so i should have known better.

1689,1,"This is based off how my stores machines operate. 

For 2% milk and skim, request specifically 3-5 milk. Specify a number. If you don’t, it’ll just say “milk” and most employees will use the lowest setting unless a number is specified. These milks (and cream) get dispensed from a machine. 

For dairy, almond, or coconut - at my store we literally eye these unless it’s a latte or macchiato. I would ask for the cup 1/4, 1/3, or 1/2 filled with milk. Pls don’t take too much advantage of this and try to shortcut a latte. Lattes are made with espresso so it will NOT be the same no matter how much milk you put in. 

If you’re dining in, ask the front counter person to communicate that w/the staff cuz I don’t think the POS has a way to note that. And if you just say “3 almond/oat/coconut” some stores are eyeballing it and are more bound to mess it up. 

And of course please be kind and patient! We are overworked and usually understaffed.

for 2% milk and skim, request specifically 3-5 milk. specify a number. if you don't, it'll just say ""milk"" and most employees will use the lowest setting unless a number is specified. these milks (and cream) get dispensed from a machine.

1765,1,"I have PTSD, ADHD, Borderline, and autism. And, one of my Mexicans has terrible side effects like making me forget things. I have to take Adderall, drink tons of coffee, hit my vape constantly, smoke weed and take kratom to feel and act  normal. 

I'm actually overqualified to work here, but I want to work here because I don't have enough self esteem to work at the type of job I studied for and I don't want to sit in an office all day right now.

Nothing wrong with working at Dunkin, I eat here every day! 

I worked here for a month in 2018 at a different location and the management was horrible. 

She hid in the utility closet aka her ""office"" her whole shift and never trained me! 

Just threw me right in! It was bad. When I switched to night shift, the woman working with me bullied me into quitting because she preferred working alone to keep the whole 10 dollars in tips she made. 

My current manager has been working at DD SINCE 2000 and interviewed me for 45 mins. She told me this location used to be really rough and the old owner ""left""  and a whole new crew came in including her. 

I then went and trained at another location to watch DU videos with a very nice HR lady. Everything seems to be going well but I'm worried about moving too slow or making too many mistakes or getting yelled at by massholes. Normal people can handle this but cue PTSD and high functioning autism. 

I think maybe a lot of people who work food service, could be similar to me. How do you handle it? I used to be a waitress for years and I honestly don't remember how I did it. Sorry if this is really long!!!

Since there's only three new items, (somehow, lemonade is already on backorder... geez.) I'll also give some personal drink recommendations and a weird story.

&amp;#x200B;

Cake Batter Swirl (in a small iced coffee, cream only): Okay, this is the one I was looking forward to the most. I love cake batter flavored things, and this was pretty great. For some reason, when pumping it it comes out thin so ask for a little extra. It's sweet, but when trying to mix swirls together it gets muddied up by the other flavors. 8/10

Butter Pecan (in a small iced coffee, cream only): When I got hired last September, we still had some and god, there is definitely a reason why everyone loves it. It's sweet, nutty, everything great. I don't care if the ice cream market looks at it as a geezer flavor, it's a 10/10!

Mango Pineapple Refresher (sample cup of pure concentrate): Okay not gonna lie, it's underwhelming. It just tastes pineappley with not much other substance to it. My mistake for doing that. 4/10 

Mango Pineapple Refresher (Green Tea): The green tea brings something out of it at least, giving it some depth besides fruitiness. 6/10.

Mango Pineapple Refresher (Coconutmilk): I'm sorry, but if I'm going to try this, I need an ambulance crew on standby. A little coconut is fine, but having a drink being half-coconut milk would probably kill me

&amp;#x200B;

Now we're in the weird stuff

Strawberry Shortcake 2.0: Ask for a vanilla bean coolata with 2 pumps strawbery and a non-cautious amount of cake batter. If you thought the vanilla bean + strawberry on it's own was great, try that.

""Illegal"" Lemonade Refreshers: If your dunkin has bottled lemonade, ask for any of the refreshers with just concentrate and room in the cup. Put the lemonade in. This has been my go to drink for the past few weeks.

Butter Pecan Hot Chocolate: As simple as it says. Butter pecan swirl, hot chocolate. Good stuff, even despite the tummy trouble because coconut oil in the hot choc

Plain Yeast Donut: So... our baker called out 2 days ago so we had way too much stock. Out of curiosity, I bit into one of the plain, unfrosted yeast rings and... EUGH! It's floury and salty with nothing really redeeming to it. It's like scraping the underside of 20 English muffins and not toasting them.

1984,1,I’m just curious what Dunkins policy is when it comes to the employees putting on the butter or cream cheese on bagels and muffins.

2003,1,"TL/DR: I'm an overwhelmed employee who used to really enjoy my job but now my work is draining me more and more and I feel torn. 

I'm getting to that point where I want to quit for real this time. I'm the main Baker, and during the golden age of my employment as I call it (last spring/early summer) I really loved my job. I made a lot of friends and work didn't feel like work. 

But in the fall of last year, things got pretty blah and now things are just getting bad. We got bought out by a big company and they're making so many changes, like the dress code. We're even changing how the donut case is organized and specific kinds of donuts go into assorted dozens now, which led to us running out of blueberry at like 7am. And I love the way I organized my donuts and I don't want to be told what to do in the one thing where I felt like I had creative freedom... Corporate obviously doesn't listen to what we feel is best and what works for our individual store. 

Worst part, there's literally so much drama lately! I almost walked out today because my coworkers are like going at each other's throats. I'm going to feel bad if I end up leaving because I know how hard it is to find a Baker. But this place has been sucking the life out of me for the past year and a half overall and I can't anymore. This isn't even to mention how the customers in the town that I work can be so mean and racist as well. We've had sandwiches thrown at us, direct threats, and some people have used terrible derogatory terms that I won't repeat here. All have been banned by our store, but similar people eventually take their place. The kind people get fewer and far between no matter how nice I am to them. All of it makes me dread coming in to work. 

I miss our old manager, but our newer manager is awesome and I know he's trying his best and he's doing well. I don't want to let him down. But I just can't do the drama anymore or the early mornings or people yelling at me. It's getting real bad for my mental health. I would be sad to leave but maybe it really is time.

worst part, there's literally so much drama lately! i almost walked out today because my coworkers are like going at each other's throats. i'm going to feel bad if i end up leaving because i know how hard it is to find a baker. but this place has been sucking the life out of me for the past year and a half overall and i can't anymore. this isn't even to mention how the customers in the town that i work can be so mean and racist as well. we've had sandwiches thrown at us, direct threats, and some people have used terrible derogatory terms that i won't repeat here. all have been banned by our store, but similar people eventually take their place. the kind people get fewer and far between no matter how nice i am to them. all of it makes me dread coming in to work.
i miss our old manager, but our newer manager is awesome and i know he's trying his best and he's doing well. i don't want to let him down. but i just can't do the drama anymore or the early mornings or people yelling at me. it's getting real bad for my mental health. i would be sad to leave but maybe it really is time.
okay rant over. sincerely, an overwhelmed dunkin employee."

I would get 30hrs a week and it stayed like that my second week. I enjoyed it at the time and my coworkers are great people.  But once my third week came I only got 16hrs. I worked the first shift but it was only 4hrs. When I came in for my second one this morning I looked around and ended up walking out. 

That may seem sudden but on top of getting yelled at no matter how fast I got (average prep time for my kitchen job was 1 minute) getting told I’ll only be getting up to 12 hrs a week from next week onwards and having to wake up at 04:30 every morning I worked well I just couldn’t justify it.

I was only making $12.50 per hour so gas alone would cost more to come to and from then I would make. Throw in my monthly bills so I wouldn’t be able to afford it. Thus leading to me resigning this morning because sadly it was the more financially viable option. 

If it wasn’t for the low hours I’d still be working there and would of been working when I’m typing this but with my low pay and the fact id be spending more money in gas then I’d make in a pay period on top of the low hours and  pay less to me leaving.

It was closing time, &amp; I was about to start counting the register. I mean come on.. it’s late, I’m tired, &amp; I’m just trying to go home. However, I let her order through the drive thru. (Out of generosity).

She orders a medium hot matcha latte with mocha &amp; whipped cream. Cool? Right? So I repeat her order 2x. Hell, my coworker heard me repeat it. I give her the latte &amp; she goes.. 

“There’s no mocha DRIZZLE on the whipped cream”. 😃😃😃 I’m like,

“No, I said add mocha in the latte”

“Excatly… you said IN the latte, not the mocha drizzle on top”

“NO I SAID THE MOCHA DRIZZLE ON TOP. I didn’t want mocha added inside”.

Clearly she was on some type of drug. Usually I let people get their way, but not today. I straight up told her that she said ADD mocha INTO the matcha latte, NOT on top. Anyways, I remake the latte the way she wants it. I’m thinking I’m good right? WRONG. As I’m walking away, she goes 

“Um excuse me… I taste no mocha inside the latte”.

Wtf dude.. Now she wants it inside after she said… Nevermind.

I remake the latte again, &amp; she goes on about how I’m ruined her night, &amp; how she’s gonna report me to the government. I truly didn’t give a damn. I shrugged my shoulders &amp; closed the window in her face.

About 5 minutes later, I hear something hit the window. She threw her drink on the window lol. I walk up to it, &amp; she’s yelling at me, DEMANDING me to go make her a new stupid latte. I told her no?? I refused service &amp; I told her that we’re closed (we technically were) &amp; That I’d issue her refund. The whole time she’s screaming about how “poor” I am, &amp; how Shes gonna report me to the GOVERNMENT LOOOL. I didn’t care. I gave her trash refund &amp; shut the window on her face again.

It does show the medium coffee’s cost as being deducted, but what confuses me is where it says ‘Perks Reward Issue -200’.

Does that mean that it used my points for the free medium coffee, or that I hit 200 and it converted those points into a separate coffee coupon? Still a little new to the app.

2356,1,"Hi everyone, I've had a perplexing morning and was hoping to get some answers from the loyal fans of DD, 

Full disclosure, I've never been to Dunkin Donuts before today. Before I met my wife, I'd spent the majority of my life in a small town where your best bet for coffee drinks was Mcdonald's (even that was only after they introduced the McCafe line-up). I'd heard of DD and seen some commercials, but never actually been to one myself. 

My wife and I currently live in a more populated area with tons of options for coffee (not joking, I didn't know what a macchiato was until I was 32), and today on my way home from work she asked me to stop in the Dunkins drive-through. One iced coffee with 10 creams 4 sugars, and a side of mini hashbrowns. 

Here's where it gets prickly, at the end, she mentioned she wanted an order of ""Dumpy Dunks"". When I asked her what those were she said they were similar to donut holes. When I pulled up to the drive-through window to place the order, everything went smooth until I couldn't find ""Dumpy Dunks"" anywhere on the menu. I asked the person taking my order if they had been discontinued and after a while of pausing he said he didn't remember that product ever being sold in store (he also mentioned that he was new). For the next 5 minutes, I waited as he asked different employees in the store if they had ever sold ""Dumpy Dunks"", all of which said no.

2545,0,"This month I quit my job at arguably the most successful coffee chain company, which I once embraced and fully loved. I worked there for just over 3.5 years. While there are multiple reasons that I decided to leave, I wanted to share my experience with reporting sexual harassment.


In February of 2021, two years into my employment at this company. A shift supervisor transferred to the store where I had worked since it opened. He ended up sexually harassing not only me but multiple female employees, including minors.

For a few months, I was in denial about the misconduct. However, many of my co-workers pointed out the ""special interest"" the shift supervisor had taken with me. Once it was shared with me that he had said borderline predatory comments to minors at my store, I decided enough was enough.

Initially, I was hesitant to speak out about the harassment because I knew the district manager, Dave Schuberth, favored him. They had weekly meetings about potentially making him an ASM.


I drafted a document outlining the harassment. I had close to fifteen of my fellow baristas who either experienced harassment or witnessed it sign their names. I presented it to my store manager, who then escalated it to Dave.

Bare minimum, I asked that this shift supervisor be transferred to another store, as he already covered shifts at other stores. I was told that it couldn't happen because it would be a form of retaliation against him.

From that point on, there was a corporate investigation for months. I continued working at the store, as did my harasser, our store manager scheduled us at different times to prevent overlap. Still, he would show up to work early or stay late due to understaffing, and he always ended up in my proximity. I often would have panic attacks before going into the store if I saw his car in the parking lot.

Weeks go by, and he makes a ""joke"" about ""punching me in the fucking face"" in front of another worker, and Dave suspends him.

Ultimately, I don't know the details of what happened post-suspension. I did receive a call saying my claims were found to be substantiated, but I wasn't told what that meant going forward. By late June 2021, he was no longer employed by the company. I found out when a barista told me he was seen dropping off his store key.

In October of 2021, I was told by a reputable source from another store that not only does this former shift supervisor frequent this store, he asked to be re-hired. I was under the impression that he was banned from the stores because I have seen bans implemented for much less.

Come December of 2021, while I'm working, the former supervisor comes in to pick up his tips and sees me and vice versa. My body immediately goes into fight or flight, and my co-workers are just as shocked. Essentially, I had a panic attack, started crying, and told my manager I was going home because I didn't feel safe.

Two months prior, I stepped down from the shift supervisor role because the stress negatively impacted me. On my last day as a shift supervisor, I was verbally and almost physically assaulted by a man in the cafe. I filed an incident report and texted my manager, and I had no choice but to finish my shift in tears. No one in management ever followed up with me about the assault. 

In January of 2022, I asked to set up a time to speak with my store manager and Dave about my concerns. Dave never gave me a solid time and ambushed me during my shift. We ended up having this conversation in the BOH, where other employees overheard, even though I said I wasn't prepared to have that conversation.

I talked about how my mental health was negatively impacted and how I wasn't happy about how the situation was handled. I said it didn't make sense to me that a former shift supervisor was able to come into the store that he was fired from for sexual misconduct. Dave told me he wasn't fired for those reasons but did not disclose why he was terminated. I also mentioned that management never followed up with me about my sexual harassment claim or the man in the cafe who assaulted me. Dave was adamant that he followed up with me because he ""had it in his calendar.""

Dave said he couldn't ban the former shift supervisor because ""if we ban him from this store, we have to ban him from all the stores."" He said it could be cause for him to retaliate. Funny how every time I asked for measures to be exercised to protect me from this individual, it's considered to be retaliation. Dave told me I could present a restraining order to enact a ban. I then was gaslit for the duration of the conversation and told to ""trust the system.""

I wasn't necessarily shocked by his lack of accountability. In March of 2020, during the onset of COVID-19, I was working a shift, and we ran out of hot water. Dave advised us to mix boiling water from the brewer with cold water and hand soap into a container we put iced coffee in to wash our hands. He told us to tell customers we couldn't serve food because ""the ovens were broken.""

Not only is Dave a sexual predator sympathizer, but he's also a liar and prioritizes sales over workers' best interests. He's the dirty car salesman of coffee.


Ultimately, I decided the job was destructive to my mental health. I made a grueling decision to quit, forfeiting two years left of my SCAP scholarship with ASU. I am now anticipating at-least three months of no health insurance as I wait for enrollment at my new job.
I started at 18 years old, trained over 15 baristas, opened two stores, built a rapport throughout the district, and was promoted to shift supervisor. I gave my literal blood, sweat, and tears to this place but was still treated poorly by management. This country has always upheld the reputations of predators, so at the time, it was very jarring to me that this progressive and value-driven company was no different.

2570,0,"Hello Starbucks Reddit. Today I come with a major concern I've had ever since I started working at my college campus's store. So I started working at Starbucks in the summer, but bc of my class schedule and lack of transportation (I have to share the car with my mom and we almost always had the same shifts so it would be either one of us driving and the other taking a lyft, most of my shifts were midday so I couldn't take advantage of the free rides). Anyway. I had to quit to apply to my store on campus, and I honestly didn't want to, I loved my manager and everyone there.

I just started this past Monday, and... I don't want to sound like I'm a know-it-all but that store is so DISORGANIZED. There's a shift supervisor in training who doesn't know how to make Fraps and the rest of the closing shift she's just wiping the counters. There's no fixed positions. I thought it would be different when I came yesterday for the midday. There was no shift supervisor, my coworkers just said I do ""what's available"". So I went on the register. Mind you, I was pretty quick with all the orders and that usual long ass line of 20+ people was now 5 people waiting to get their order in. However, there were people waiting 10+ minutes to get their order, and I feel really bad bc the drinks are not standard made. To give you an example: they put the refreshers directly in the cup, no shaking, no nothing, NADA. And since our customers are college students they gotta take whatever bs they're served bc they got class or are in a rush to somewhere and can't bother stay longer to complain bc it already takes too long to get a matcha latte 🗿

Listen, correct me if I'm wrong, but for refreshers you put all the contents in the shaker, and shake. Not put the stuff in the cup then put it in the shaker (which they did... sometimes, very few times actually). Another thing... they don't sequence. People saw me deliver 3 drinks at once, they were giving drinks 1 at a time... 🗿 so no wonder why people always complain that the line takes too long. 

Next, the closing shift on Monday was too long. We should have been able to have everything clean by 10/10:30, just ring some last orders and close at 11. But because no one is delegated any task, people just do what they think they should do. No one has done the cabinets, and yesterday I felt bad bc one of the supervisors (for the food stations on campus) came to order some drinks and pointed out that our registers were dusty... Tell me how we got 4+ baristaa doing drinks and we still have a long ass line (we don't even have a drive thru, thank God bc with how things are run, that would be my 13th reason). The manager knew I had worked for Starbucks in the summer, and it feels like I'm the most experienced in that store (but to put it into perspective I've only worked at Starbucks for 2 months, some of thess people have been working at the campus store for years... I'm trying to meet with the manager and express my concerns but before I do I want to make sure I am in the right here, and if you could advice me how to go over these issues without it sounding like ""I know better, I should run the store"" bc no, I don't know better, I'm just doing  part time, and I won't offer to be a shift supervisor bc I know that takes training and weekly meetings which I would probably not be able to go to with how packed my schedule is (I'm studying to be a teacher and I have to do in-person observations for my courses, add the clubs I'm in, and the other classes, I barely make time to work and study). 

There is a lot of other stuff too I could mention, like how everyone leaves the milks outside the fridge and without the cap... I'm not joking, I've had to ask for 2% milk 10+ times during each shift I've been so far. Bc they keep moving it around, because no one restocks until were fully out of the last bottle of milk... like I said, I'm honestly really stressed by this situation and I wonder what I can do or what the manager can do to fix this. Idk what the training is for the new S.S. but she doesn't even know her Fraps, she's very sweet with me, and again none of this is personal but I can't just put a blind eye to the fact that this store is running by the grace of God or smth bc if it was an actual store I bet Karens would have drowned it and put it to rest.",venti rant about my (college campus) store,1663166075,"venti rant about my (college campus) store hello starbucks reddit. today i come with a major concern i've had ever since i started working at my college campus's store. so i started working at starbucks in the summer, but bc of my class schedule and lack of transportation (i have to share the car with my mom and we almost always had the same shifts so it would be either one of us driving and the other taking a lyft, most of my shifts were midday so i couldn't take advantage of the free rides). anyway. i had to quit to apply to my store on campus, and i honestly didn't want to, i loved my manager and everyone there.

Revenue: The company expects revenue growth between 10% to 12% from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2025. This includes earnings growth between 15% to 20%, which is up from 10% to 12%.

Business Plans: Starbucks sees this growth as a result of its newly announced $450 million investment in U.S. stores between 2023 and 2024. Meanwhile, the company also rolled out a new partnership with DoorDash (NYSE: DASH) on Tuesday.

Stock Price: These improvements are needed to turn around the company. The stock price is down 24% this year.

Final Thoughts: Investors should be excited about these plans. New CEO Laxman Narasimhan starts his role on October 1.

I have my onboarding &amp; finishing up paper work this saturday &amp; plan to bring it to my SM attention that I will unfortunately be needing a week off, which will essentially be my second week on the job. I will also have restrictions the following 3 weeks, I should be perfectly fine on bar, drive thru, POS, but just cannot lift heavy weights like boxes or ice buckets. I am extremely stressed out now as I really am looking forward to this job but understand that this is unfortunate timing. Is there a policy in place, or could I possibly be let go for this considering it is so soon after employment? Any tips for speaking with management or policies I should be made aware of?

2635,0,"So I've been working at Starbucks for about 4 or 5 months now and I'm constantly having to sit down and get talked down to by my manager. In the past couple of months I've had problem on top of problem on top of problem happening at home regarding family and the death of my pet. 
My manager always has something to say about my attitude or the way I come into work or how I work.
I work opening shifts and before this job I've never had to wake up that early before. I was always getting up at 9 am rather than 4 am in the morning.
Recently she's said this:
1. When I come into work, even if im tired and mentally/emotionally exhausted, I should greet all of my coworkers and say good morning and get right to work.
2. I can't do dishes during peak (which I haven't done for the past 2 weeks. I'm trying not to piss anyone off and just stay out on the floor as much as possible)
3. I have to stop being disrespectful to my shift leaders. ( everyone assumes I'm being disrespectful when I forget to acknowledge them when they ask me to do something. Usually during peak. I get so stressed out I forget to tap the headset to acknowledge them. Sometimes I even forget to put my headset back on as our front/CS because I'm constantly taking orders up front and forget to put it back on.)

Or I'm so cold in the mornings now that I ask if it's okay for me to just drink a hot tea. My shifts usually tell me it's fine and I don't have any other drinks out.

Toughing it out, is exactly what I've been doing and it's not enough anymore. I feel like I'm being told to push every emotion aside and only have a smile/chipper attitude while I'm working, even with my coworkers. They always have something to complain about when it comes to me. Everything I do isn't good enough I feel like.

my manager always has something to say about my attitude or the way i come into work or how i work.
i work opening shifts and before this job i've never had to wake up that early before. i was always getting up at 9 am rather than 4 am in the morning.
recently she's said this:
1. when i come into work, even if im tired and mentally/emotionally exhausted, i should greet all of my coworkers and say good morning and get right to work.
2. i can't do dishes during peak (which i haven't done for the past 2 weeks. i'm trying not to piss anyone off and just stay out on the floor as much as possible)
3. i have to stop being disrespectful to my shift leaders. ( everyone assumes i'm being disrespectful when i forget to acknowledge them when they ask me to do something. usually during peak. i get so stressed out i forget to tap the headset to acknowledge them. sometimes i even forget to put my headset back on as our front/cs because i'm constantly taking orders up front and forget to put it back on.)

I find myself in a bit of a pickle, so if anyone can help me out, it would be very much appreciated. I need to give my notice asap, because something unexpected has happened and I can’t keep on working for the company, even though I want to leave on good terms.

The situation here is that I’ve been working for the company for a year, but as a shift I still haven’t finished my probation period (3 months) which ends in 2 weeks time. I’ve been reading the contract and all the booklets they give you when you are hired, and I find it to be quite confusing.

In the chart it is written that baristas that have been working for less than 3months have to give a 1 week notice and +3 months is 2 weeks notice. But, for shifts if you’ve been working for less than 3 months it’s just 1 week and if it’s more it’s 4 weeks. The confusing thing is  which one applies to me. Because it’s been less than 3 months as a shift but more than 3 months in the company. 

I work in the UK, and I’m aware that almost everyone here works in the States, but it would be really helpful if someone could help me solve this or if they could tell me how they understand it.

I was having lots of anxiety as the people their seemed very standoffish and unwelcoming when I got there and the shift was very unhelpful. It was a rough first few hours getting used to a different store layout, but then a new shift gets on the floor. New shift is very welcoming and helpful, really helped me feel more comfortable on a new floor and helped me relax and find my flow. Afternoon rolls in and I'm now in the window. I go to grab something and new shift hands drink to customer out the window. Lady in her car asks something about me and misgenders me. New shift corrects the customer on my pronouns for me. I never told them my pronouns, they had looked before hand in the system and already knew them. Probably one of the most validating things anybody has ever done for me... Customer then asks my shift to talk to me, so I lean out the window and ask what I can do for her. This lady then hands me a card and I go to grab it. She's holding onto it extra tight so I can't even take it. She then deadpan stares at me and says ""I think you need this"". I just say thank you and finally pull the card from her hand and tell her to have a nice day. The card is a Welcome Jesus into Your Life card.

For the past twelve weeks (since July) I've been the ONLY supervisor scheduled almost every Sunday. Open to close, both food counts, either placing the order or putting away the delivery, and running the shift with half the staff we need for weekend traffic, having to send half the team on break at the same time just to keep up, all in just eight hours, and then I hear that the other supervisors complain about how bad the closes are as if I can do anything about it (my weekday closes are perfect, by the way). 

I've been on vacation for two weeks and my manager assured me that the two new supervisors he hired would be done their training by the time I get back and I could have Sundays off for a few months. But when I checked the daily coverage report for the week I return, sure enough it's the skeleton crew on Sunday again. It's the day after my birthday, too - some birthday present this is! Also, mobile order and pay is going to launch before I return (my store is in Quebec) and I don't trust my DM to turn it off in spite of me never having run this shift with MO&amp;P active before.

for the past twelve weeks (since july) i've been the only supervisor scheduled almost every sunday. open to close, both food counts, either placing the order or putting away the delivery, and running the shift with half the staff we need for weekend traffic, having to send half the team on break at the same time just to keep up, all in just eight hours, and then i hear that the other supervisors complain about how bad the closes are as if i can do anything about it (my weekday closes are perfect, by the way).
i've been on vacation for two weeks and my manager assured me that the two new supervisors he hired would be done their training by the time i get back and i could have sundays off for a few months. but when i checked the daily coverage report for the week i return, sure enough it's the skeleton crew on sunday again. it's the day after my birthday, too - some birthday present this is! also, mobile order and pay is going to launch before i return (my store is in quebec) and i don't trust my dm to turn it off in spite of me never having run this shift with mop active before.

2761,0,"Got a new manager recently and we had our 1on 1 yesterday. My take away is that he's the type to just give in to customer demands because ""We don't get paid enough to enforce the rules"" and he can't really be bothered. My issue here is that this ultimately affects all of us. As it is we already have customers constantly trying to side step our boundaries and the few ""rules"" we do have. I think having healthy boundaries helps everyone, it creates product consistency, empowers baristas and is respectful of all of our partners. If we just spoil our customers they will go to other stores and then we're the ""other"" Starbucks that will do whatever they want.

Our store is severely understaffed right now. We also have a new out hired manager who is not qualified for this job.
Yesterday I asked to come in a bit later than 7am (which was my scheduled time) because I was having severe back pain from working 7 days straight, having one day off, then working 6 straight days again. (Also I was not asked if I was able to be scheduled that much, they just did it without making sure it was ok with me or the 2 other SSVs it’s happened to)

(I have been working in the food service industry for 12+ years now. I always let my management know about my back. I even let my district manager know.)

I was told I can’t come in late because 2 other people called off, and it was just my manager and a trainee working. I ended up calling out because I told both my manager and my DM that I am uncomfortable working such short staffed with this back pain and would be risking hurting myself more and calling out if I really threw my back out and missing more work than necessary. These flare ups happen two to three times a year, and again, they know. I have never called out for it before as I started working here last November. 
My DM wanted to fire me for it, but my SM ended up fighting for me and I got written up instead.

This has been hurting me for about a week, and last Thursday I was very vocal about my pain but did not ask to go home or leave early, but genuinely felt unsupported by the other staff working and strained my back even more. 

Basically my question is, am I able to fight a write up? I was trying to get transferred because this store is chaotic and it’s just too much. Also was supposed to start the ASM program but now can’t for 6 months.

however. when you come help as a borrowed partner and then start to point out to me (the keyholder), my manager, and anyone else who will listen what is ""wrong"" with our store, you are not doing a good thing. you are not making a good impression. you are hurting the union movement.

Because the customer ordered a drink that came out to $7.00 USD after the mods they had requested — because the customer was too lazy to look up the price on the website or app before ordering, and because they’re ignorant or unwilling to learn that it’s CORPORATE, not the baristas that are setting these prices.  

I will never understand what crawls up someone’s ass and dies, and makes them come into a place of business... then have the audacity treat &amp; speak to the workers like they’re literal garbage, whether something is the workers’ fault or not.   

Even if the drink that YOU as a customer insist on having 85 mods to &amp; barista accidentally forgets one, or you don’t like the price because you’re too stupid or lazy to look up the prices, you have zero right to take it upon yourself to speak to another human being like they’re literal garbage and deserve to be your verbal punching bag.   They are human beings, just like YOU as the customer, and under zero circumstances is it okay to treat them with anything less than kindness and respect.   

And if at ANY point you feel that treating another human being who is serving you like garbage &amp; like they deserve to be scream at and cussed at, then I have one piece of advice for you.   It is a sage piece of advice that I have used for years when I feel like I am about to lose my shit on someone who absolutely does not deserve it for things that are beyond their control.   You have absolutely got to step back and say to yourself in a REALLY firm, almost snappy voice because you deserve it, “BE FUCKING NICE!!”    Trust me, it is MUCH more effective for both of you, and it will get you much further.  It would also cause your entitle ass not to scream at your servers &amp; baristas and make them feel less than, or ruining their entire day because your stupid ass drink “isn’t made correctly” or made up to your “standards”.  Another way to look at it, is that if you’re being a complete asshole to your server/barista, they’re going to be A LOT less willing (mentally and motivationally) to help you, because you have already taken everything out of them over to your screamfest temper tantrum.  

I left a job because of customers like that, who thought they were free to talk to me like I was literal garbage as soon as I said something relevant to their claim they didn’t like, or that the policy didn’t cover them for this, that, or the other.  Customers that would raise their voices at me, swear at me, make threats to me, and behave like an uncivilized human being.   In fact, I have become a walking billboard as to why people should NOT work that position.","i just read a post on a starbucks facebook group from a barista who was left to cry in the bathroom of her starbucks, because a customer thought they were entitled to yell at, scream at, cuss out the barista.",1662924108,"i just read a post on a starbucks facebook group from a barista who was left to cry in the bathroom of her starbucks, because a customer thought they were entitled to yell at, scream at, cuss out the barista. over what, you ask? because the customer ordered a drink that came out to $7.00 usd after the mods they had requested -- because the customer was too lazy to look up the price on the website or app before ordering, and because they're ignorant or unwilling to learn that it's corporate, not the baristas that are setting these prices.

Trans woman, 23, diagnosed with gender dysphoria at 4, transitioned at 16/17 &amp; medically at 18. 

I have had Ky Medicaid my whole life which covered HRT &amp; bottom surgery. Nothing more. I got Tricare in 2020 which essentially is a fight for hormones alone, &amp; no other surgeries being offered. 

I have my consultation for breast augmentation on the 30th as I was going to pay for it myself, however, Discovering my surgeon accepts Aetna, I went the Starbucks route. 

I had my interview today, 100% getting hired, will know for sure on Monday. 

My issue is, I have no idea what is going on with starbucks insurance, the new policy changes, or what exactly I need to do step-by-step wise. 

I already have letters from therapists referring me for surgery, 4-5 years hrt, 7 years living as the preferred gender, the criteria is met. 

What do I need to do to, once I’m hired &amp; working 20 hours a week minimum, to make a breast augmentation happen. Will I choose my plan that my surgeon accepts (Aetna) and be enrolled in that on December 1st (1st day of the month following 2nd month?) Will I then have the green light to schedule? 

My surgeon is an hour away at the states largest hospital so I assume he would be considered in network if that is what the policy change is about. 

Would love to just hear your tips or experience &amp; timeline &amp; really learn as much as I can before I begin nothing management &amp; trans advisors (I don’t even know what those are!) 

TLDR - How long after start date until coverage is able to be used for surgery, criteria is already met prior, tips for step-by-step to make this happen as quickly as possible.

When a food ticket prints, I stick it onto the top part of the metal holder where the bags/plasticware are. This is so when the food has more than one item I can visualize when to put each item in and it gives me an idea for how many more there are to go. This is also so I can stick the ticket onto the bag when the food is in the oven and place any necessary items into the bag. The bags in the holders are packed so in a rush I still have to pull the bag slower or they will all fly everywhere.

Apparently we should be immediately putting the tickets onto bags, which isn’t a problem until there is a food rush. All of the bags can’t fit onto the small counter for larger food orders, I end up throwing the wrong food into the oven/not throwing 2 items of the same thing because they printed at different times, and it takes more time overall. I hate warming so much because of how small of a space I have to work with+the volume of morning customers ordering 3+ food items.

I know technically I can have up to 200mg a day which would allow me to have a grande size but I’m trying to limit my caffeine intake further. I know decaf still has some caffeine but would be well within my daily limit. I know there isn’t a decaf option for cold brew but was wondering if there are any substitutions that would make it similar.

3050,0,"I do not care about Starbucks. I do not think most of the stuff we sell is any good, and absolutely none of it is worth what they charge. When someone is doing a hack to save money I am not being robbed. But let me tell you why I care about standards. 

I care about standards because this is a big chain with many locations in each geographical area. That means most customers visit more than one Starbucks in their area. They might have a regular store they visit, but maybe also one by work or one by the shopping center or whatever. 

I do not care about the customer's experience. I do not care that it is consistent. This is not why I care about standards. 

What I care about is the customer's *expectations*, and how that can impact my fellow workers at stores that are not my own. Now the customer, you must understand, is a low-intelligence, high-demand creature, one that lives largely on sugars and foams. These customers, little more than feral sugar pursuers, do not know what is in their drinks, do not know how their drinks are made, do not usually even know the actual names of their drinks. But what they do know is that if one store lets them make a fake latte by getting two shots in a grande cup, light ice, fill it with half and half, they will come to expect that. What they do know is that if one store lets them get their Americano in a trenta cup, they will expect that. 

Now, when that customer heads to another store, a store where perhaps the employees stick to standards, that customer will - more likely than not! - become a monstrous pain in the ass to the low-paid worker who is just trying to make a drink the way they were taught to make a drink. 

What this means is that a barista at location A, by training their customers that they can get whatever they want however they want, is making the life of a barista at location B much, much harder. 

Standards supposedly exist to give customers a standard experience across all stores, but for me they exist to protect my fellow workers - they are the ones who will bear the brunt of the fury of the monster I create when I break standards for a customer. My greatest fear is becoming the person the customer is talking about when they say ""the other Starbucks does it for me all the time."" I never want to be the other Starbucks.

We lost pretty much all our original partners and all we’re left with is new partners who have been cast into the fire with rushed training just from being so understaffed and needing people asap. Which means most of us have to pick up everyone else’s slack. Im so beyond tired. So burnt out. I fantasize about just walking out and never seeing them again. I wish I could just put in my two weeks but unfortunately I have bills to pay. I’m thinking of going on LOA but idk anything about it. I don’t wanna ask any higher ups to help me cuz I just know they’d try to sabotage my leaving. Especially since my sibling works in the same store and would also like to go on LOA for the same reasons. Would a mental health loa require a bunch of hoops to jump through? I’ve read people mention basically getting a note from a Lyra therapist so that I can go on LOA. I’ve never signed up for Lyra but would I be able to just do one session and straight up just tell the Lyra person that I just need a note from them so that I can take a break from work for a bit? Or would I really have to do a bunch of sessions just to get a note. I just wish I could get an loa in the easiest fastest way possible that doesn’t require a bunch of hurdles.

I had just finished training and, me and my manger came to the conclusion my DOB was entered wrong, however he assured me that wasn't a issue, and we moved on.   
Now, that was fixed, then on friday, my check never went into my bank account. After I messaged him about this, he told me he would take time and look into it in the coming morning. Now 2 days later, I text him back about it, and he finally responded saying to log into our work computer to go to the partner hub.

Then we hung up and he said he would have to fix it, got a text about sending him a picture of my ID and said everything should be fixed.

The Java chip Frappuccino is a long time favorite of mine and as the weather cools down I was wondering if anybody here could make a suggestion for a hot drink that has a similar makeup?

Back then, I felt so inspired and enthusiastic during my first few weeks of working. Old co-workers were so nice and customers clearly have patience with me. With practice, I become better at everything. Not gonna lie, I learned a lot. But ever since then, things felt so different. Every day I walked in, it was literally peak period. There were aggressive customers who rang mad-modification drinks, I even felt super bad for making their over-sugared drinks for them. Although there were some regulars and partners that warmed my heart, all of them had left sadly. Literally every week I will see a new face smh. I am cool with new people joining our community, but our store is so busy. And clearly, they are not ready for such tasks. So all my shifts just have to put me on the bar. I was lucky enough that I even had done hot bar, cold bar, and mobile bar as a continuous rotation throughout the same shift.

Once in a long while, my coworkers will text me to do a check-in and see how life is going, but now, they only texted me when they want their shift covered or help because people called out. Because of that, I lost all my faith in everyone and became anti-social when I was working. There was also some tea like I secretly know one of the partners romantically liked me (I am just 20 and I have school;-;). It’s not a bad thing but it does creep me out because I often work with her.

after this was over, i handed them their items, straws napkins etc, and went to clear the transaction from my screen. no extra pleasantries since our drive times were screwed enough as it was, when they paused their snickering to yell ""you have a good day *as well*"" in the nastiest voice i've ever heard on window
it completely knocked me out of my zone to the point where i made a few simple mistakes after that. i just felt like crap. you're rude, impatient, and then unnecessarily nasty after all is said and done?

3348,0,"Hello baristas, I have a question to ask of those of you who have been at stores for a while and seen new partners come and go. I am a fairly new hire (beginning of last month) and was hired at the same time as another girl. There were two other new hires before us, and there have been two since.

My manager has made comments a few times that I am falling behind the other girl, even having her ""supervise"" me making drinks. We work very similar hours, but usually different shifts, so technically, we should both be getting bar practice. But it does not seem to be the manager's priority to give me any, putting me on bar for 10-20 minutes in a 4 hours shift before sending me to clean bathrooms, hand out on drive or do customer support. My supervisors and manager are VERY strict about the plays and roles, so it's not like I can ask them to put me on bar longer.  

When we were finishing training, our trainer told us that we wouldn't get much time on bar for the first few weeks as the previous two newbies needed that time. But now that the two new hires are out of the training modules and in the bar, the supervisor has been putting them on bar over me again, so I am still not getting practice.

It is beginning to make me wonder if they have already decided that they are going to fire me once the new people are trained. The jobs that they put me on need very little training, and it feels like they are just keeping me around as a helper until they can replace me with someone else. On top of that, I am not being given enough hours (no weekends despite being available) to reach benefits, which makes me even more suspicious that they aren't bothering to put that much effort into me because I won't be around long.

Do you think I am reading too much into these behaviors, or have you seen something similar happen before with a new hire? I just keep waiting for the play caller to put me on bar, but it never comes. I'm beginning to feel a bit discouraged with the whole situation.

Thanks for any feedback you can give me!",am i being replaced?,1662480105,"am i being replaced? hello baristas, i have a question to ask of those of you who have been at stores for a while and seen new partners come and go. i am a fairly new hire (beginning of last month) and was hired at the same time as another girl. there were two other new hires before us, and there have been two since.

I've had 4 managers in the months I've worked for a licensed store. The third one wasn't really a manager but was the one with seniority.

About halfway into her being ""manager"" she told me that I have been clocking off, without doing anything before leaving, like leaving mid rush or not making sure I take the trash out. Even though I'm not able to take trash.

I had told her, I understood her concerns but I also explained that I need to clock off when I'm off because we aren't allowed overtime and get a meeting with the boss if we do so often and ill try to do better, plus I'm not allowed to do trash because of reasons. I also said this has happened to me before with other ppl and asked if this is a issue that needs to be brought up to managers now?? She had told me that I need to comunicate with the other baristas and not to bring anything up with managers or management and if I do, she'll tell our bosses and that I don't do anything during my shifts. 

Even now when she's not manager she tell me, it's not hard to do simple things or that I half-a$$ everything or don't do anything correctly. She is leaving in month, should I say something to her about this treatment or should I just wait it out???

So I'm like 1.5 months on board, past training, and have been taught closing. I'm kind of frustrated because I am available all day 5 days a week, 6 coming soon. This said, store manager is still bringing in new hires and I just heard today they are looking for an opener. I only get scheduled 28 hours a week. I have mentioned in the nicest ways that I would live longer shifts. 

When I covered for someone:
""Hey I *really* appreciated the longer shift."" in a text. 

When a customer asked if they were hiring and I heard about the opener shift, once they left I said:
""Feel free to train me and I'd love to do it.""

At the end of closing today I told my SM a third time:
""I would really love to work longer hours,"" which got a silent smile and nod.

When I applied and interviewed for this job I said I was looking for as much of a full time schedule as possible. I take every opportunity to cover for people. I have had no complaints and when I asked how I was doing after initial training I was told I am above average for a new person. Since then, I can work bars, CS, Customer Support, planted or not. I might ask one question a day about a drink I haven't heard of or a specialty order.

...Yet we are bringing on 2 kids not old enough to work a full week by law, just finished training one before them, and apparently we need an opener.

I want large shifts, 8 hour shifts / 40 a week or as close as possible. What should I do? At this point I feel like I'm a bother by bringing it up.

The only thing I considered was that the SM told me at hiring that they try to keep people in training under 6 hours, but I'm not getting trained anymore. There are a few modules to do that are very obscure and SM hasn't made time for (due today actually). But I was also told that, as a person who wants Starbucks health insurance, that the store prioritizes hours for those people. Right now I'm going to *narrowly* make the 3 month consecutive hours to obtain insurance.

Advice? I've been so direct to SM. When you make 15.50 an hour I don't get why we need sooooo many people. I'm here, I'm available, I've made it known. Everyone likes me. Do I share my interest with the district manager at this point? The only thing close to an acknowledgement my SM was after I told them I'd be available for an extra day come October, to which they replied, ""Awesome! We need people on those days.""

like not that new people can't ask questions, or that everyone is supposed to know all the ins and outs, but like if you're waiting in line and see the picture, and have ordered from me before, i feel like you should just be able to say ""iced pumpkin latte no whip creme yes topping"""

3427,0,"Hi partners,
Please don’t groan at me, but I’m looking for a barista position while I’m in online grad school. I used to be a supervisor at an aquatic facility, but quit after 2 years because I was consistently working 60-80 hour work weeks, and that was too much for me. I have great references, managerial experience, a ton of customer service experience, and I’m ServeSafe Certified. I also have wide open availability since my school is online. I recently interviewed for a barista position at a drive through location. I thought it went amazing and they basically talked about the hiring process with me (GM said he had other interviews that weekend, but I would hear back around next Tuesday). On Sunday I got the email that I’ve been rejected.
I see there’s an opening for a “Barista Lead/Lead Cafe Server” at a local Barns and Noble Starbucks. Now one thing about me, is I will give amazing customer service to anyone. I’m very polite and people-oriented, but I HATE places that hard core peddle things like credit cards or add ons. The job description says that I will have to be willing to promote add-ons and sales. I just hate bothering people with a sales pitch. However, since this is an “assistant manager position,” I might have a better shot with this location since I think that’s the reason the last location didn’t see me as a fit. Anyone who works at a Barns and Noble Starbucks- how is it different? Do you really have to pitch sales or just ask if customers are in the B&amp;N Rewards program? I’m fine asking that to customers as long as I don’t have a quota of add-ons or signups to meet.

Well, it used to be, but ever since they started serving them in those straw-less cups, drinking one has been an existential nightmare.

I was reminded of this today when I got that new Apple Crisp Iced Macchiato. Delicious, except the lack of a straw made it subpar. One of the things I love about some Starbucks drinks is how layered they are, something relatively unique among most coffee places. Having a straw lets you experience each layer as you desire. This is doubly true for anything with caramel or other heavy sauce in it, since it sinks to the bottom. You can use the straw to get a little bit of sweet syrupy goodness into your sip whenever you feel like it.

Except with these (relatively) new cups, that's a thing of the past. You don't get to experience the layers, you just chug the espresso part until you get to the milk, unless of course you shake the whole thing until it becomes a completely different drink. And forget about tasting any of that syrup, it's gonna stick to the bottom of the cup the whole way through.

I literally never get these drinks on the go anymore, I can only have them when I've gotten home, and can use a spoon or something to experience each layer, and I don't to explain to anyone why that's a miserable experience.

What killed me about this job was the forced customer connections. Me and the other partners are always being told by our store manager that we'll get fired if we don't improve our customer connections. I was always being told to sit down at customers tables and ask them what they're up to and how their drink is. My store manager would stand next to me, whispering in my ear ""tell her that her scarf looks nice"", ""they're on their phone, think of a way to get them to talk to you""). It was so draining.

My relationships with the regulars over the years started going downhill when they started to realize how forced the conversations were (me, panicking on bar during peak with sweat falling down my face: ""HI HOW WAS YOUR DAY TODAY?!"", them: ""good how are you"", me: GOOD HOW ARE YOU"", them: ""you asked that already..."", woops).

Over the years, I constantly felt depressed, and anxious. I always took work home. I was stuck in the barista position with no opportunity of moving up because my customer connections were bad. I would say 90% of the baristas and supervisors I've worked with were all dealing with severe anxiety too.

&amp;#x200B;

Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I hope this is allowed. I see a lot of baristas on TikTok talk about their negative experiences being employed with Starbucks and I wanted to share mine. This might be sorta long so thanks in advance if you choose to read.

I came to Starbucks as a barista with several years of supervisory experience at another high-volume food chain. I trained at a different store than the one I was hired at and was noticed as a fast learner by management and other partners alike, with some even making ""undercover boss"" jokes because I didn't seem like a trainee. After about three months and with some encouragement from several shift supervisors at my store and the one I trained at, I applied to be a shift supervisor at my training store. I interviewed and got picked the same day, which meant more hours and a major pay raise for me, which I was in desperate need of because I had recently left a toxic relationship and I was financially devastated. I was SO excited about this opportunity, it was everything I ever wanted!

The beginnings at my new store were rough. My first day went as planned with mostly computer-based training the whole day. The next day, another shift supervisor tested positive for COVID-19 and went into isolation, along with several other partners and I believe another shift supervisor too. I was told I would be a regular barista for the week and my training would resume the following week, which was no big deal. 

The following week, I thought my training would continue as planned. I thought I would finish the computer training, shadow a supervisor for the week, and then be on my own. On the first day of continuing my training, I came in for a mid-shift and was told I was actually running the floor. And so training was over. I had mentioned this to the ASM and SM later on as I was concerned I wouldn't know everything and mess something up but they insisted I got my full training and I was fine.

I thought I did mostly well. A lot of other partners were really annoyed with my presence as they wanted my role (and deserved it more since they were far more seasoned). It was so intimidating because I felt like all eyes were on me and any question I asked about this store's particular setup (I couldn't remember from when I first trained there) and SS-related questions felt like I was being discredited and it was proof I wasn't qualified for my role. After a while, however, I think I grew on most of them and I even made some friends. 

I was dedicated to my job. I loved it. I felt I went the extra mile quite often there. I covered others when I could, went in early/stayed late almost every time I could, and never had a problem switching with other shifts. I never gave any of my partners trouble about calling out/leaving early/whatever and always made it work even though I was only ever given JUST enough partners to make the store run with no ""wiggle room"" (if I lost one partner for the night it guaranteed complete chaos).  I never turned away a barista that needed a ride home.  Being mainly a closing shift, I was the only authority in the building from 2 pm to close, and I had to deal with a lot of dangerous situations (unpredictable homeless people, drugs being done in the bathroom, etc.) But I always faced it. 

Things got sort of rocky about 2 months into this role.  One of the shifts that also worked close showed me that when she comes in, she takes one till from each register and two from one of the front registers as you usually don't need it for the rest of the night, so I started doing that. On one shift where the ASM worked with me for a few hours, he found out and scolded me. He had put that till back in and I had completely forgotten as I was so used to taking it out, so it stayed in the register overnight. Not too long later, I had closed and left the cash pouch in the back, on the desk. That was my verbal warning. I was told I would receive a written warning next time, and if I made another mistake after that I would be terminated. 

I was starting to stress. Things in my personal life were also not great and my mental health was taking a nosedive. There were multiple occasions where I tried to get my shift covered because I just felt like I couldn't do it but management told me there were no shifts who could cover it as everyone was already at 40 hours. Every time I worked I was terrified my next mistake was around the corner. I had asked management multiple times if I could switch to mids or mornings. I explained that I felt that nights were for more seasoned shifts as they work it alone with no other shift or manager to peer review. My store's opens usually had the SM, ASM, and two shifts. Our mid usually had one shift that overlapped with open and close but they had no open/close duties obviously. It just didn't feel fair that on top of not being properly trained, I had all this responsibility, and nobody was ever there to check that I wasn't missing anything. They told me there was just no way for me to not work closes. I tried to do my best with what I had and take a more positive outlook on things. I got myself a to-do list of the most important things to check, I was seeing a therapist through Starbucks, and I felt like I was doing better.

It was clean play night. I had agreed to work every clean play in exchange for working two mids a week and being off on Thursdays and Fridays (which I never received). In the weeks prior I had been asking the ASM if the morning shifts had any feedback for me on my clean plays as nobody ever left comments in the book. I never got trained on what to clean save for one night I did it alongside the SM, but we had a callout so he said we were going to half-ass it just this once. There weren't guides on Store Resources for every single thing listed on the clean play checklist. I was eager to know how to do EVERYTHING in the store so I was constantly looking to improve. one of these days when I asked, the ASM wanted to know what I didn't know so I asked him to show me how I'm supposed to clean the cold brew system and he basically just showed me to wipe down the top parts. This day, though, he told me he had feedback from the morning shifts and he listed a bunch of things not getting done, including the cold brew. He then gave me just a verbal walkthrough of the super complicated ACTUAL way you're supposed to clean it which was not what I was told by him before. He gave me a resource printout and was sure to leave at his scheduled time as always. 

The night was super stressful, I tried to take apart and clean it myself but even though I did it as instructed it wasn't working. He tried to walk me through it over text but ultimately told me I had to leave it because it was clogged from not being cleaned correctly for weeks on end, which he definitely blamed me for. By the time he told me to give up and leave it for the morning, it was 11 and I still had to count drawers. By the time I was done, my partners had long been finished with their tasks and were waiting on me. As I was going to put the drawers in the safe, the bottom one slipped and they all spilled on the floor. In tears, I had to pick up the coins and recount everything. I told my partners to just go home. I know I wasn't supposed to be there alone but they had been waiting so long already. I finished around 12:30 I think and finally went home.

The next day, I was feeling much better. I had just finished the process of applying for the ASU program, and I was feeling very thrilled about the opportunity to finish the biology degree that I've been trying to get for 4 years. Immediately after I called and scheduled a meeting with an SM next to my boyfriend's house because I was moving and this store was looking for a morning shift. I was so thrilled.

But when I came in, I got fired. I had left the deposit bag on top of the pastry case ""overnight"" (opening shift comes in at 3:30 so for three hours) and therefore I needed to be automatically terminated, but I was welcome to apply anywhere as a barista after thirty days.

That was 5 months ago. I have applied to so many Starbucks here so many times, I have called and talked to the SM's about my specific situation, asking to just be a barista, but they never moved forward with me. I have probably applied to at least 300 jobs since then and haven't landed a single one. I'm constantly on job boards looking for the next ad. I can't even doordash because my car is broken down and I can't afford to fix it so now I'm limited to remote jobs or jobs within walking distance. Debt collectors are constantly calling me. I've had not a single dime for five months. I tried to apply for unemployment twice but Starbucks fought it and won. I'm still grieving everything I lost; my job, my chance to go back to school, my path to financial stability. and I hate myself so so much for that negligent stupid mistake and now I'll never get redemption, and I still feel like I was let down by management who promised to support me in my journey but rarely lifted a finger for me when I needed it. I know I should be over it by now, but, you know... what I could have been. Something so much different.",terminated from starbucks- my story,1662340187,"terminated from starbucks- my story tldr: i was fired after management neglected my proper training and i made too many mistakes after reaching out for help several times and being let down.

I asked her if she came to this store and when, just to get more background so I could check the book, since my store keeps records of those who call for a remake and she said she had. I couldn’t find any record of any remake that entire week and she didn’t know who she had spoken to and didn’t have a receipt in the app or physical, no cups, nothing. Our store has a policy where we won’t replace drinks that were made more than three days ago unless they call to let us know they won’t be able to come in until then. Come to find out she got it last Friday (the day she said she got it changed twice, but this was the final answer) so I checked that week and sure enough it still wasn’t anywhere there. To appease her, (because she said how dare I do this to her in front of her kids, who weren’t paying attention in the back seat) I remade a different frap and split it into three cups, while she called me an “idiot with absolutely no sense“ and other names and demanded my name, which I gave to her.

i guess my question for this is: what am i supposed to do on brewing station? i know im supposed to watch the coffee but what else?

i am also a closer with this same ssv. dont get me wrong, they are a good person and they have well intentions, but they really have a way of treating me like im still a very new person. i am still learning but they treat me as a kid. it wasnt until my gm intervened where they finally left me alone on bar and left me alone to watch the floor. i think they low key hate me for that intervention which sucks. there will be times where i am working with another partner who has been here longer. id be doing the floors while ssv is in the back doing ssv things, so the partner is solo-ing when its dead and they'd be going back and forth for restocks, make more lemonade, get more inclusions etc and the ssv is fine with it. but when im solo-ing while its dead, the ssv grills me for ""leaving the floor empty"" (despite me taking around 10 seconds to go to the back then to the front). it's worse because the ssv will always tell me to start prepping inclucions, mocha, whipped creams and more while im solo-ing but none of the clean containers are on the floor which means i have to go to the back to get them, but i cant because im solo-ing. so me solo-ing is not productive with this rule.

i guess my question for this is: what am i supposed to do on brewing station? i know im supposed to watch the coffee but what else?

3660,0,"I've been working for nearly two months as a barista. I get a lot of positive feedback from other shift managers, I get kind corrections from them, I feel safe asking questions to them or just being open with them about my thought process and clarifying the root of where I messed up if I make a mistake. At this point, they all seem to trust that I know what I'm doing in a lot of areas, that I'll ask questions when I'm unsure, and they ask me if I know how to do certain things just in case they need to clarify anything before assigning me a task or so they can ask someone else if we're busy and someone else is more prepared/knowledgeable etc. I'm constantly doing work, never just standing idly and if I am it's for 7 seconds thinking about what I should be doing   


But this one shift manager................. They tell me to do things I'm expected to do regularly, even if I've already done them. And in a way that I feel like I'm being talked AT, not to. They come look over my shoulder and criticize what I'm doing, even if it has nothing to do with any specific processes I was trained on or even if I'm literally actively doing something a certain way that they or other managers have told me to do in the past. An example of the former is that I got critiqued for having sugar packet trash right next to the cup... as I was putting in the last 2 packs of sugar.... and was already planning to throw away all the trash immediately after finishing putting in the sugar. An example of the latter was that I was pulling a bunch of warming tickets (today was busy all day so there were constantly many tickets) after running several items to hand off, and I was trying to see what all bakery I'd need to grab and if there were any doubles of anything so I could warm them at the same time. In the middle of my thinking, I got critiqued for pulling the tickets and was told I should already have things cooking in my machines. This is true. But I swear they've also been a person before to tell me I NEED to pull tickets otherwise I'm gonna fall behind by not cooking things 2 at a time when I can. This is an example of how I feel like I'm always doing SOMETHING wrong, even if I KNOW I'm doing what I've been told to do in these super specific situations.

I know it’s a tough job on most days and customers can be horrible , I strive to be simple and kind to baristas knowing what I’ve experienced during my time at Starbucks.

Today I went in for my first pumpkin cream cold brew. …. Yes I know I am that person. 

I normally order it as a tall in a grande with foam to the top. 
I know it’s annoying. I get it. Mostly because our mind always first wants to get the tall and you have to switch it. But we also know we will just end up wasting the foam anyways. 

The barista at the store told me I had to order the grande if I wanted the extra foam. 
I said okay that’s new but okay charge me for the bigger size but please don’t do more cold brew. Too much cold brew and I get extra jittery. 

I shouldn’t let it bother me but I don’t understand if this was a her problem or Starbucks thing? I looked on the app and the way I ordered it would not have charged extra for the foam to the top.

3704,0,"So  I got hired by starbucks about 60 days ago on the dot. I didn't finish my week of training until a few days ago, and I was finally a free bird away from my trainer. My trainer was honestly not the best. She was sort of very condescending, I had to ask permission before doing almost anything, she was sort of rude all together, and just kind of a shifty trainer for me. She would tell me to be faster, but stand at the bar and wait for the person to arrive and pick up their drink every time. Unfortunately I cannot do both. 

The day after I finished my training, another partner (a ss) called and asked me to cover for them from 7:15 to 10:30).. I agreed because I figured a shift super would know if it's okay for me to be covering this early off my training. I come in and my shift is just a wreck. I was on window for about 2 hours but once they switched me to bar (my first time ever) it was so bad. The printer would not stop and there was only one person helping me. I had 30 cups with stickers lined up and ready to go and customers were getting upset. And then....someone orders 2 venti lattes with 6 packets of agave each. So here I am squeezing 13 packets of agave into these damn cups and it hits me. I cannot do this job. 

So I texted my manager the next day saying this Jon is not for me and I will not be coming back. I said it a lot nicer than that though. Should I feel bad for not giving my 2 weeks? I figured it was completely unnecessary seeing as I hadn't even finished my week of ""practice shifts"" and was absolutely not an asset to the team in any way.

3706,0,"I’m a shift and I have a barista partner that I work with FREQUENTLY (maybe 3/4 of my shifts are with them). We have the closing shift, so it’s typically just me and them. They’ve been one of the main closing baristas basically since they transferred to our store. And they’ve been at our store for probably 5 months now. They were a partner at another store for a few months before that. 

So, at this point, they should really have a grasp on how to do just about everything. We even have a written out closing list. But for some reason… it’s like I have to tell them HOW to close during EVERY close. If they aren’t sure what to do, they’ll just… kind of pretend??? To wipe the counters???? It’s like I’m SEEING wiping happening, but I guess it’s just too gentle?? Almost like they’re wiping the counters to look busy instead of doing it to clean them.

The part that I need advice about isn’t even really that. It’s the fact that this barista… works so slowly. All. The. Time. We have several green beans now and they’re all essentially lapping this barista. We’ll have customers waiting for a single drink for 5 minutes. And this partner won’t even use that time to connect with the customers. Sometimes I’ll work with a barista that doesn’t really connect, but it’s because they make the drinks so fast that the customer doesn’t even notice. But with this barista… the customers just sit there for FAR too long… waiting for their drink. It’s not even just making drinks that takes too long. It’s every task.

So, I guess my question is: how do I tell this partner to PICK UP THE DAMN PACE?

3740,0,"I walked in today, threw my keys in the safe and quit.

I started at a drive thru Starbucks that was busiest in the district and loved it. I was living in my car attempting to survive and I appreciate the company for that.

Moved to a city and went to a Starbucks that did 15k+ a day and can only be described as a place where baristas go to lose hope for 6 months before transferring to a cafe. All 7 of the transfers that came while I was there all quit by their third shift.

I finally hit a point a week ago where I was reprimanded for being too talkative on register by my boss(outside hire).

3745,0,"I quit Starbucks yesterday and my mental health immediately improved. This is the tea I was scared to spill and share because I did not want to jeopardize my job. Now, I don’t care. Y’all need to know the truth.

While there was coworkers who I truly enjoyed working with, there were some I truly did not. I will just leave that at that. That’s with any place, right? But when the problem people aren’t corrected, that’s an issue. Anyways…

I loved learning about coffee and honing the craft, but quickly it became apparent that Starbucks no longer cares about that. They just want to continue making billions off of their dedicated followers and their sugar infused coffee addiction.

While working there, I dealt with some of the worst working conditions I have ever been faced with.

Firstly, the fruit fly problem. If you want my advice as a former employee, ask for no fruit pieces in your refreshers. Don’t get anything with vanilla bean powder, chocolate malt powder, java/frappuccino chips, and matcha. These are all stored in semi-open containers that do not close fully. Therefore, fruit flies chill in and on the containers. I had to work the day before we got the pest control treatment for our store and a fruit fly flew up my nose. They were landing all over me. Landing in drinks, landing on food. Some baristas didn’t even throw the drink away they would still hand it out. A fruit fly was found in the cold brew keg before we closed it up and my shift scooped it out and put the lid on to use it still. So, additionally I wouldn’t drink the cold brew. I wanted to quit there and then.

Secondly, the store I worked at needed a remodel so so badly. It had ceiling tiles missing, our AC would break all the time, and the drain would constantly back up. When I, the ONLY one who spoke up at the store meetings with our district manager, asked about a remodel she said “Other stores would be grateful for what you have.” We were told we were on the list but low on the list for a remodel. Two store meetings later the district manager announces two new stores. So they can build new stores that no one asked for but can’t improve the already existing stores? Awesome! 

Our ovens literally set the pastries on fire. Cookies would light on fire. Sandwiches won’t cook all the way through. They’re still waiting on new ovens. We finally got new espresso machines the beginning of this year. How does a billion dollar company not have the funds to outfit every store with quality equipment?

Thirdly, (and this has nothing to do with the company… although, they encourage this “customization” culture) the customers are 80% entitled assholes.  
Even when I worked at Olive Garden, McDonald’s, Cheddars, etc. I never encountered some of these kinds of people. I got cursed out for being out of Sugar Free Vanilla. I got yelled at through the speaker box because I was out of caramel drizzle. I got complained about because this man was yelling at me about how he wanted his latte made &amp; I corrected him for being an asshole (respectfully, with much effort). A man once asked me for exactly 16 ice cubes. I was making someone else’s drink with the standard scoop of ice and he threw a fit thinking it was his drink. I looked at him dead in the eye and said “This is not your drink.” His face turned red from embarrassment and he sat his ass down. People complained about their mobile orders never being ready when the truth is, everyone and their momma is sending their order in between 6 am and 10 am so you are gonna have a wait regardless, Karen. Don’t yell at me cause your 4 venti (large) overly sugared and complicated lattes aren’t ready. In truth we needed a third espresso machine, but we’re lucky to have what we did, remember? 📷

Fourth, the management. During the time I was there (11 months) there was two Store Managers. The manager that hired me left two months later. We were without a store manager until about february/march. The man that was a hired (a truly kind man) was an outside hire who was entirely new to Starbucks. He lasted 3 or 4 months I think, no offense to him. He did his best trying to make our store better and they ran him off.  He left at the beginning of July. We were without a set store manager for the month of August and instead of us getting a new one they pinned our store onto another store manager! She doesn’t answer texts, you can only call her. When you did call her you got voicemailed. And if you or what you had to say wasn’t considered important? Good luck getting a response! 

I asked to have a meeting with District Manager to discuss all of these issues above, and yet was met with contempt because I was “supposed” to reach out to the temporary Store Manager who had her own store to run and doesn’t answer calls. I never fully got to express any of this to anyone but other Baristas at work who were also fed up.

I am grateful for the wonderful people I met, but I implore you, if you’ve read this far, to go to a local coffee shop. The whole company needs to unionize. There is no reason our store should be as dilapidated as it is when we’re one of the top earning stores. SBUX CEO can get a billion dollar bonus, and we can’t get new machines.  


There is way way more I could share, but I close with this:

if i order a grande sweet cream cold brew, it arrives with liquid up to the top and filled with ice. this suggest that there's less liquid than if i were to order it without ice. if i order it without ice, it arrives with liquid up to the same level.

my question is this - what is the extra liquid? is it more cream? is it more coffee? is it just a little more of both? my target is to get more cold brew, but not sure which is more strictly controlled - the coffee or the cream?",a question to baristas regarding cold brews w/o ice,1662158979,"a question to baristas regarding cold brews w/o ice hi all, thanks for taking the time to read this dumb post. i just have a quick question with a long intro, hoping someone can shed light.

3760,0,"I stopped by NY Starbucks location to grab a cup of coffee although there were other cafes nearby cuz I knew this one had a restroom I could use. While there was a wait in line, I asked one of the employees for the WASHROOM passcode and I would like to inform you of the terrible experience you could get from this store. 

When I politely asked for the passcode, she/he replied there is no such thing as a restroom in this store. 

So I pointed to the place where all the people were using it, and then he/she replied "" oh there was one? I did NOT know that"" with a very sarcastic tone. 

I asked him/her again politely (ex. could you ask your co-worker) since that denial attitude was appearing to be intentional, and he/she was clearly rejecting to respond to my question. She/he even said the restroom passcode is posted on the wall. (Meaning she knew we were talking about THE WASHROOM. So of course, I replied, there is not. Then he said, ""then I don't know lol lol ?""

The employee's attitude was distinctly rude and intentionally denied to tell to the specific person. I found this extremely disrespectful and I truly felt that was racial discrimination. 

I understand that everyone has a tough day, but this situation like asking for a passcode would not possibly make any employee upset. 

After that, I shared this conversation with the employee who’s in charge of the store at the moment,
As soon as I approached to her, she suddenly ran into me and finally informed me the toilet code and apologized that she thought I was asking for WIFI password since WIFi and WASHROOM sound the same. Looool. 


 In where does Starbucks have Wifi password? 


The one in charge told me that he/she had had a tough day today so I gotta understand? This interprets to me as that whenever she/he has a hard day, she/he seems to take it out on other customers who look seemingly easy-going and have different racial appearances.

3839,0,"**tl;dr at end**

I'm here to rant because this particularly involves my current (and new - since mid early August) job at Starbucks. So, to first provide my context, I stopped working at a restaurant job (that I was fairly new in late April-early June this year) to pursue my professional certificate in cybersecurity. I had stopped working for about 2 months because I passed this certification after 2 months of hardcore studying (woo!). I decided to quit the restaurant job that I was working at because I never really liked the workplace anyways and it wasn't my cup of tea when it comes to working in the service industry. Management also sucked too.

Fast forward, I'm now hired at Starbucks and currently working as a new employee when school starts. Since I had switched my majors, it's taking a bit longer for me to finish my degree so I decided that it was in my best interest to do an extra load of classes. These **online** classes were already accelerated enough but instead of the standard full load of 5 classes, I did 6. (these classes are a quarter long, btw. 8 weeks each and there's the first 8 weeks of the semester \[first session\] then the 2nd 8 weeks of the semester \[2nd session\] so the classes are divided by 2). I had already planned this out before I got my job at Starbucks and now that school has started, I'm starting to realize the consequences of having a physically tiring job with an overload of school work. Though I only have 3 classes, all of them are expecting of all students to do continuous studying and engagement, combined with labs, projects, and tests.

Throughout this whole ordeal I also found out that I needed to pay for my own tuition for this upcoming winter semester and I'm about $5000 short so I'm trying to earn as much as I can so my parents don't have to pay as much and we can split the money. So me working is definitely a necessity.

I guess the best way to sum up my problem is that my (somewhat) physically and mentally (sometimes) taxing job at starbucks is not mixing well with the extra load of class that I'm taking. It's already hard enough to find time to go to the gym and enjoy my own time but it seems like I'm either working, studying, eating (while working and studying), or sleeping. While I know that the most common solution right now would be to lower my hours, I don't think that lowering hours would help my case since I still need to earn enough to where I can afford to pay for most of my tuition next semester.

I've been thinking about a job that's remote and something along the lines of customer service. Which not only makes it easier for me to manage my time with classes but also just to get out of the food/beverage industry. I've been working in the this industry since 2019 and needless to say, I'm quite exhausted from all the physical hard work and mental stress when it comes to dealing with hangry customers.

**tl;dr** \- i'm stuck at a wall. I hate to leave my new coworkers because everyone is so nice and I hate the idea of job hopping but I'm also realizing that the physical and mental demand of starbucks is not mixing well with the stress of my classes but i'm forced to work due to tuition so i really dont know what to do",(rant) school is clashing with job,1662093775,"(rant) school is clashing with job **tl;dr at end**

to test it out i put in a grande iced chai with only 3 pumps of chai and it tried to charge $2.40 for the chai so we had to put ask me's in for the amounts of syrup which became complicated if it was multiple syrups with different amounts

1) Several years ago the cups or lids changed, and lids became much less secure. Coffee drips out no matter what - yes, the seam is opposite the lid opening. I’ve had some baristas and managers agree that something obviously changed, but they were never able to explain. Our collective hunch is that corporate changed suppliers. 
2) Store volume. Music has been turned up to a much higher volume in the last year or so, and on top of that, the staff seems to be in a competition for who can make the most noise. Slamming things around, dropping things then laughing wildly, yelling at each other despite having headsets, and shoving that ice door so hard it could possibly launch into the parking lot. I’m in upstate South Carolina but have noticed this in plenty of stores nationwide. It used to be a semi-quiet place to get stuff done while enjoying friendly baristas and good music. It’s bordering on a loud dive bar at this point.

I’m sure we’ve all noticed the BS Starbucks is putting us lesser paid employees through so please read my situation and any advice or help would be great.

I’ve been working for Starbucks for almost 5 years. I’ve always tolerated it for the pay and my lovely coworkers. (There’s not much high paying jobs where I’m from in Texas, but trust me.. starting last week, I’ve applied to almost 25 different jobs)

Around 8/17 my ASM, SM, and DM had a sit down conversation with me at the beginning of my shift to discuss others partners concerns of my mental health and well-being. I agreed that I have not been doing okay, but it’s not any of my managers business especially if I still do my job correctly. They showed me a log of my clock-ins and outs and tried to tell me they can write me up for me being ONE MINUTE LATE two days in a row. They also tried to tell me another SSV remembers me pulling a no call, no show which is completely false. I remember specifically calling in sick that day… which I have every right to do. Now, me being late by 60 seconds is because of the Covid check ins we have to do. 60 seconds. I understand policies are policies but are you kidding me?

Anyway, I was essentially faced with either taking a 4 week LOA and that I can file for disability through Sedgwick to get paid for my leave. OR I can take the write up and continue with work and just take the day off. Knowing I am grounds for demotion after this second write up (if I accepted and signed it/didn’t take the medical LOA) I feel like this is completely messed up. But it’s okay because they’re offering/reassuring me that I will still get paid… so I thought.

I had immediately contacted Sedgwick for a case and all that to see what was needed to get me paid with the LOA hours I earned. Sedgwick is now not paying me anything for disability considering that they need my psychiatrist’s say so on documented paper for 4 weeks off of work.

This wasn’t my psychiatrist’s idea, it was my managers. I can’t ask my psychiatrist for something he didn’t even do.

2 weeks later, I am now completely broke, lost my brand new apartment that I can’t even afford to break lease at. I’m back at my moms where I’m not necessarily welcome. I feel completely screwed over by Starbucks. I feel like I’m purposely being thrown out of work for something that I didn’t deserve. 

I already tried the CUP fund for a place to live but my manager had denied it. I tried calling Sedgwick but I’ve gotten hung up on TWICE by accident I’m assuming and now I’m trying my best with PCC. 

If anyone can help me do something about this, I would love the input.

3932,0,"so for some background, i work at a pretty high volume drive thru/cafe store, i’ve been a barista for about 4 months or so now and the day i was hired was also my SM’s first day, so naturally it’s been a bit of a transition for the whole store. not to mention with school starting we just lost half of our staff, we just outside hired a bunch of shifts that are having to learn barista AND shift duties and everyone is worn completely thin. ALSO! there’s always something broken or that we’re out of and the time it takes to get it fixed only for it to break again or run out again within hours is insane!!! i’m absolutely sure this is not a problem specific to my store but moving on

as we all know, pumpkin spice season started 2 days ago. so naturally, we’ve been pretty damn busy. we still have the old mastrenas at my store, so we pull blonde from the drive bar hopper and decaf from the cafe bar one. the entire drive thru mastrena broke the day before pumpkin madness started, so we can’t pull any blonde shots and we’re down to one machine for cafe/drive/mobile. cool, we can manage, just have to be careful what order we’re pulling tickets and making drinks since there’s only one machine that can pull shots. today, decaf went down which is really great considering it is the only thing besides like herbal tea and milk that doesn’t have caffeine in it :,) oh yeah and our nitro machine works probably 2 days out of the month, to the point our SM has started consistently telling people in drive thru who try to order it “it’s like the mcdonald’s ice cream machine, it’s never up and running haha lol”

we have no blonde espresso, no decaf espresso, no nitro, the poor baristas who end up on hot bar are dripping sweat and nearly in tears trying to keep times down and make drinks right on the ONE working machine and cold bar is running around trying to do all they can to support hot bar and keep up with their drinks too, all while we have people legitimately shrieking about pumpkin spice over the headset in drive thru. the ticket was put in for the blonde bar multiple days ago now, and lord knows how long it’s gonna take for them to come fix it. i’m just waiting to hear that our other mastrena bit the dust and we have no espresso bar whatsoever lmao. 

i just feel like the team we have is so strong, the majority of our tools and supplies are just either broken or missing completely, and we aren’t ever able to actually be set up for success due to the lack of actual tools we need to be successful to the standards they want from us

this was longer and significantly harder to follow than i meant for it to be, but that is also how every single shift i’ve worked for the past week has been so it’s fitting

ps someone confirm for me that the chicken and bacon panini was discontinued bc my SM yelled at me today bc i told someone that in drive thru but the button is gone and i also actually read it somewhere probably the weekly update???? i feel insane who can relate

3984,0,"One day I decided to go to this one branch instead of Barnes and Nobles to study because I was bored. 


The first 3 minutes I sat on the table studying, this one barista said ""Hey you"" and I'm like ""me?"" She asked if I wanted this free frappe and we had a brief convo about it. I found that little interaction cute so after studying I'm like ""maybe I'll get another free frappe again if I come back"" jk I just like talking to people. 


So I went back again the next day, she asked how the frappe was, another brief convo. But that was it. I kept going everyday (I'm a 2 week regular now) she always hi to me and asks how I'm doing everyday then she started serving the drinks (the tables are kinda far off from the counter) to me that I got mixed signals if she was flirting or just being really nice.


So I asked my other barista friend if this girl was flirting and she said yes. So that made me make scenarios in my head on how would I make my move to try to get close to her that I ended up being shy when I get to the Cafe and seeing her that I acted cold and didnt even greet her. Then I realized I had a big crush on this barista.

After that, she was off for a couple of days and then when I finally saw her again, I did the same thing and acted cold. For the whole time I was there studying I wanted to talk to her but she was working and I'm shy like an anime school girl, 


I finally snapped and made a scuffed letter from scratch  
I spent the entirety of my stay working on it but in the end it was still so bad but I saw her with her bag about to leave that I had to rush my letter and I basically asked her out in it, when I saw her leave I ran to her, couldn't find my words I just said ""hey"" covering my face with my arm because I was blushing too much. Gave it to her and I ran away. 


After that I have not seen her for the past 3 days so I'm thinking maybe she quit because that interaction was the cringes thing she's seen all week. Am. I just overthinking or she hates me 😭 


tl;dr. Barista was really nice to me that she became my crush. 1 or 2 weeks later, I gave her a letter saying ""ur really interesting, let's go out"". I have not seen her for 3 or 4 days ever since that

So I need opinions

4028,0,"Dear Baristas,

I am a long-long-longtime customer of Starbucks.  I pick up coffee every morning on my way to work.  At this point, I haven’t missed a day in over two years.  Sometimes I use the drive thru, but mostly I place my order on the app and run inside to pick it up. 

What I am met with, each and every day from the baristas is a smile and a warm hello.  Yes, I’m a regular, so they all know me at this point.  But I see them do it to everyone.  Whether or not you’re asked by management to do this is beside the point.  It’s genuine, and I can tell.  

To all baristas:  Thank you.  I’m convinced you don’t hear that enough. 

Morning is an interesting time of day.  When you see your customers, their day has either gotten off to a good start, or a bad one.  Too often you’re on the front lines of someone fighting a bad day.  They make you the face of their problems and lash out, nearly always, for no reason.  I’ve seen it happen. 

I can’t think of a place that requires multitasking more than Starbucks.  I watch you.  I’m in awe of you, honestly.  You are taking endless orders, all customized, while handling cash transactions and listening to gripes from customers.  And the Karens.  There are so many Karens. 

The teamwork you display on a minute-to-minute basis is inspiring.  As a hiring manager of my own firm, seeing Starbucks Barista on a resume will always get my attention.  You are such a talented and hardworking group.  You may argue that there are exceptions, and surely, anytime you employ as many as you do, there will be exceptions.  But they are so few and far between.  They are not who I’m talking to.  I’m talking to YOU.  Thank YOU. 

Your coffee literally makes my day better.  Even when there’s not enough cream.  Or too much cream.  Or it’s not hot enough.  Whatever.  It’s coffee.  The world will not begin or end with my coffee.

But I know my day will begin with a smile from my barista.  And for that, I am grateful.",an open letter to baristas,1661970534,"an open letter to baristas dear baristas,

4102,0,"Man. I still think about my job at Starbucks and how much of a nightmare it all was. Basically, I had just graduated from college with a bachelor's of science degree. I applied for several jobs in my field, but was often shot down for not having enough experience. So I decided to just apply to Starbucks thinking it might hold me over until I find something more legitimate. I ended up getting hired. 

But man. There I was, getting paid next to nothing, getting bossed around all day by high school students, being stuck with the filthiest jobs nobody else wanted to do. I was educated with a legit science degree, probably more educated than most people there if not everyone, but everybody treated me like I was just the stuuuuupidest idiot in the whole store. They gave me barely any training at all, and then would get pissed at me or treat me like I was just an idiot if I had a question or didn't know how to do something. Anything that ever went wrong, even things that I had absolutely nothing to do with, I would get blamed for. Someone put a cafe order on the mobile order stand? I must have done it. Drive thru line moving too slowly? It couldn't be the BARISTAS in charge of making the drinks....it had to be the *stupid idiot* handing them out. I swear when working DTR or DTO, I was constantly berated over the drive thru times, even though it was obviously the baristas who were taking too long to make the drinks. Just because I happen to be working DTO, doesn't mean I have control over the drive thru times. 

I was also micromanaged to hell. Any slight thing I did differently, was the wrong way to do it. If I ran a customer's card before handing them the drink, I was berated for it. My manager would constantly be standing over my shoulder, talking to me like I was a 4 year old child explaining how to run the credit card and hand them the drink. No customer ever ONCE complained about me running their payment before handing their drink. They didn't even notice, it didn't even delay them whatsoever beyond like a second or two. If anything, they would get confused by me handing them the drink as they were handing me the card, like this awkward fumble. And then the one time I do it my manager's way, the customer's payment gets declined after I hand them the drink. Of course she wasn't around to see it, so I probably got blamed for that too. I also remember one time when it got slow and nothing was going on, so I went into the back room to take a drink of water for like 30 seconds. At which point, I was literally berated for taking a tiny break and drinking water. 

Nobody ever trusted me to work on bar. I would often get *trained* to work on bar, but then the next day I'd just be stuck on DTO or cleaning the bathrooms or some shit and never worked on bar again. I would have loved to make the drinks, like whenever I did it it was actually fun for me, and I felt like I was doing something important for once. But I was considered too stupid to ever do it. For the 6 months I worked there, I probably worked on bar for a total of 2 minutes. 

Eventually I just got so fed up. I remember one time someone who I went to high school with came in, driving a nice BMW and wearing nice clothes, clearly successful. And there I was with my little stupid green apron and hat. So embarrassing lol. I just couldn't handle thinking about what bullshit was in store for me the next day. I started showing up late, but I'd still do my job the best I could. Ended up putting in my two weeks notice, but my manager fired me literally the day before my last day, just one last ""fuck you"".  

Sometimes customers could be assholes, for sure, but the people I worked with were even worse. At least an asshole customer doesn't stick around standing over your shoulder the whole day. I recently went back to my old Starbucks and found out that hardly any of my coworkers even work there anymore. Not even my manager.",starbucks was easily the worst job i ever had.,1661906751,"starbucks was easily the worst job i ever had. man. i still think about my job at starbucks and how much of a nightmare it all was. basically, i had just graduated from college with a bachelor's of science degree. i applied for several jobs in my field, but was often shot down for not having enough experience. so i decided to just apply to starbucks thinking it might hold me over until i find something more legitimate. i ended up getting hired.
but man. there i was, getting paid next to nothing, getting bossed around all day by high school students, being stuck with the filthiest jobs nobody else wanted to do. i was educated with a legit science degree, probably more educated than most people there if not everyone, but everybody treated me like i was just the stuuuuupidest idiot in the whole store. they gave me barely any training at all, and then would get pissed at me or treat me like i was just an idiot if i had a question or didn't know how to do something. anything that ever went wrong, even things that i had absolutely nothing to do with, i would get blamed for. someone put a cafe order on the mobile order stand? i must have done it. drive thru line moving too slowly? it couldn't be the baristas in charge of making the drinks....it had to be the *stupid idiot* handing them out. i swear when working dtr or dto, i was constantly berated over the drive thru times, even though it was obviously the baristas who were taking too long to make the drinks. just because i happen to be working dto, doesn't mean i have control over the drive thru times.
i was also micromanaged to hell. any slight thing i did differently, was the wrong way to do it. if i ran a customer's card before handing them the drink, i was berated for it. my manager would constantly be standing over my shoulder, talking to me like i was a 4 year old child explaining how to run the credit card and hand them the drink. no customer ever once complained about me running their payment before handing their drink. they didn't even notice, it didn't even delay them whatsoever beyond like a second or two. if anything, they would get confused by me handing them the drink as they were handing me the card, like this awkward fumble. and then the one time i do it my manager's way, the customer's payment gets declined after i hand them the drink. of course she wasn't around to see it, so i probably got blamed for that too. i also remember one time when it got slow and nothing was going on, so i went into the back room to take a drink of water for like 30 seconds. at which point, i was literally berated for taking a tiny break and drinking water.
nobody ever trusted me to work on bar. i would often get *trained* to work on bar, but then the next day i'd just be stuck on dto or cleaning the bathrooms or some shit and never worked on bar again. i would have loved to make the drinks, like whenever i did it it was actually fun for me, and i felt like i was doing something important for once. but i was considered too stupid to ever do it. for the 6 months i worked there, i probably worked on bar for a total of 2 minutes.
eventually i just got so fed up. i remember one time someone who i went to high school with came in, driving a nice bmw and wearing nice clothes, clearly successful. and there i was with my little stupid green apron and hat. so embarrassing lol. i just couldn't handle thinking about what bullshit was in store for me the next day. i started showing up late, but i'd still do my job the best i could. ended up putting in my two weeks notice, but my manager fired me literally the day before my last day, just one last ""fuck you"".
sometimes customers could be assholes, for sure, but the people i worked with were even worse. at least an asshole customer doesn't stick around standing over your shoulder the whole day. i recently went back to my old starbucks and found out that hardly any of my coworkers even work there anymore. not even my manager."

Flash forward to today, I am working as a Business Analyst/Project Manager for my Local Government's IT department. I love my career and enjoy what I do but I have been craving working at a Starbucks again, honestly since I left. I genuinely miss being a Barista so much.

I've inquired about open positions at some of the local stores within 5 miles of were I live (There are 4 stores) and the Store managers have told me that Starbucks has never offered seasonal positions for employees and that Starbucks recently implemented a minimum amount of required hours worked by partners of 12 hours per week, and a minimum of 17 hours of posted availability.

Me: what size? 
Customer: venti

Me: it can come with either one 
Customer: lemonade then 

Just a tip to customers. Whenever you order ALWAYS order with the size FIRST and if it’s hot or iced. 
Good Example: I would like a Venti Iced Caramel macchiato
Bad Example: I would like a caramel macchiato 

You can even say small, medium, or large, we know what you mean. DO NOT say “regular size”. 

At the window, DO NOT WAIT until I have handed you ALL of your items to ask for things. If we are waiting on something or even when I take your payment, ask then. This includes straws, napkins, cream, sugar, stoppers, sleeves, bag, cup of water. It’s a massive waste of time. 
 
Baristas aren’t technically allowed to offer straws for drinks that do not require one as our cups are literally meant to be used without a straw. 

It’s very frustrating when I’m doing solo DT and a customer is waiting on their drink and waits for me to hand it to them to ask for a straw. I am already slower as I’m solo but it slows me down even more when people do that. On top of that, just ask for everything you want. Don’t wait for me to come back with your cream to ask for another thing and then rinse repeat.

you can even say small, medium, or large, we know what you mean. do not say ""regular size"".
at the window, do not wait until i have handed you all of your items to ask for things. if we are waiting on something or even when i take your payment, ask then. this includes straws, napkins, cream, sugar, stoppers, sleeves, bag, cup of water. it's a massive waste of time.
baristas aren't technically allowed to offer straws for drinks that do not require one as our cups are literally meant to be used without a straw.
it's very frustrating when i'm doing solo dt and a customer is waiting on their drink and waits for me to hand it to them to ask for a straw. i am already slower as i'm solo but it slows me down even more when people do that. on top of that, just ask for everything you want. don't wait for me to come back with your cream to ask for another thing and then rinse repeat.
a woman was at our window for literally 9 minutes doing this!"

1. Absorb as much as you can from your training and never be afraid to ask for help.

2. Try out other brands of espresso, starbucks isn't that good tbh.

3. Its not a bad thing if you're not always on bar. Others need a turn and you might just aide your team better somewhere else.

4. We are a team. Not everyone gets along but try to support your team as much as you can. It makes for an easier shift. 

5. Be kind to your openers, odds are they have the highest traffic hours. This is a coffee shop.

6. Your closers want to know what you need to open. They don't need to know every little thing that was wrong.

7. If you're opening, fully prep and stock everything you can think of. It can turn your whole shift around.

8. Do NOT live and die for this job. It can be fun but its a job. Your joints and bones are not worth the wear and tear. 

9. If you're a high schooler be respectful of your full time partners. This job is their livelihood and not always a fun place for you to chitchat and play around in. 

10. Stores that gossip all the time are not worth the hassle.

11. Grow a thick skin. The things customers say and do to us can be vile and rude. I promise holding on to any of it will hurt more than you need. 

12. Find your regulars, these customers will be the best you have ever known and are more than worth the trouble of others. 

13. Unionize. Your managers are more often than not, not a good source of information about unions and cooperate does not care about us 

14. Do not be afraid to speak up against your shifts to your manager if something wrong is happening. Your concerns deserve to be heard

15. Enjoy it. Starbucks is a rush like no other.

Do you know how many of your ""partners"" have anxiety attacks on a daily basis about work, having to come to work, or how they will afford to live?  Probably not - most of them hide/mask this for fear of losing their jobs.

You have stripped their will to pour their hearts unto their jobs, you have run them ragged by not providing enough coverage hours to do their jobs in a way that would make them and customers happy.

4297,0,"The good ol' shaken espresso with no ice bullshit. We have a new regular who has been ordering this drink. Venti Shaken Espresso, No ice, No Classic, with Almond Milk. Naturally when I arrived at this drink while bar supporting I told the baristas to let me know when this person showed up so I could explain that this drink isn't meant to be made this way. The baristas informed me that this regular is deaf and they have a hard time communicating with them so all of them have just been making a Venti Iced Quad Latte with no ice, essentially. 

Today I got the mobile order again so I wrote on the cup ""This needs to be ordered as a latte, thanks."" I genuinely am not trying to be rude, I just want them to get what they want and understand that a shaken espresso is not what they are actually ordering. I'm not sure what will happen next or if they even noticed the note however I'm not going to give someone special treatment just because they are deaf/hard of hearing. Actually I find it quite rude when someone acts entitled because of a disability. I try extremely hard to treat everyone the same, equally, no matter who they are or how I feel about them (if I know them well). Everyone deserves to be treated fairly. I feel as though it is not fair to give this one person a pass just because they aren't willing to try and communicate with us.

That being said, I'm not sure if anyone has ever actually explained to them that this drink cannot be shaken and *IS,* in fact, an iced latte. I guess we'll see. I have not checked the price difference on a venti shaken espresso vs a venti iced quad latte. I don't know what the correct way to go about this is, I'm just hoping maybe next time I can actually talk with her somehow to help clarify what these drinks are so that she can order exactly what she wants.

What would you do in this situation? Am I wrong for writing a note on her drink? Was I rude and/or inconsiderate?

Ever since I applied I started to get attacked by my manager Carley Houser out of nowhere as if she was trying to find ways to fire me. My 1st warning is understandable I take full responsibility but the 2nd to the separation letter is not sitting well with me. I was told that on august 9 I would get an interview but then my manager was nowhere to be found which is understandable I’ll wait till Monday the 8th when I get my 2nd write-up out of the Blue Moon but it was small lateness not big numbers and it was my final notice for the last two weeks I felt uncomfortable working there. Recently on August 1st during that time we had a shift that quit so we had no closing shift and have been closing the store early cause there was no outside shift that didn't wanna help or close on their day off. On August 22 I came in expecting there to be a closing shift it was enough time to find coverage. I thought wrong I came in at 2 pm hearing that the store was closing in 3 hours I was there in shock so my mind was to do support and do the close at the same time while hearing the morning shift she wants to leave she doesn't deserve this we have to leave 5 on the dot while I was stressing About the trash if my partners are okay Then we kept getting false information that a shift from Bayonne was coming never came by the way. The store was closed at 5 and left at 5:30 then I heard mumbling from the morning shift wny and edge water I didn't put my mind to it cause I clocked out I was scheduled 2-8 wanted to go home.Then my manager started to text me if I went to edge water an hour later I scratch my head I told her I left and was on the highway that was an hour away From Starbucks and tells me to turn around and come back. The following day she asked me what happened I told her she said well I don’t know what Kevin the district manager thinks about this situation and said clock in and see if your numbers work which shocked me which felt like a threat. Two days pass by I was worried and then the day came I get the letter it didn't affect me on the spot but these past two days have been taunting me every partner thinks that the separation was wrong it bothers me a lot because there are partners that came at the manager call out constantly who always come late but never get talked with or written up and the night crew is thinking she's coming at the night care only.

i don't know but i feel humiliated in some way. previously there were multiple times where her coaching seemed a bit pretentious. she'd start her comments with ""can you please \[...\]"" or ""you're supposed to know this/that"". i accepted it in the beginning because i was a new barista, but i just can't do this anymore :/ i also don't really know if this is because of starbucks policy or something, but none of the shifts at my store ever work at the drive-thru, they're either on front or customer support.
i'm always placed at the drive-thru. i'm really starting to despise it, i've asked if i can be switched, and my morning shifts say that it's my only option--that i can do dtr/dto, or both. i'd work in the afternoon since the closing shifts are way more laidback, but i can't because of school. i'm really thinking about putting in my two weeks because honestly this is my last straw ://"

so i used to work at the starbucks in bullseye and i moved out from it. while i was there, there were no rules against any kind against makeup or hair colour. you could wear lipstick, eyeliner, you could have funky hair, etc.

one of my friends just started working there with their partner, and they just dyed their hair pink and were told it's not allowed for sbux employees and they had to dye it a natural colour. their partner also told me that they weren't allowed to wear any kind of makeup except eyeliner, no lipstick or anything.

is this a new thing, or is this just the bullseye management giving them false info? because they weren't told by the manager for the sbux, they were told by a manager of bullseye.

4349,0,"Hi yall I was curious if there's such a thing as a Shift Trainer. Like barista trainer but for shift supervisors. I was trained for my position by my store manager and we haven't hired a brand new shift since I've been there. We've just had people transfer in who had some prior experience as a shift. So I was just wondering if only store managers can train baristas to become shifts, or if it's possible for a shift supervisor to train people to become shift supervisors? I ask because we just had this new shift transfer in and he only had a little experience as a shift, but did all his training already, but my manager had me run a bunch of shifts with him to train him. But it was just me like free wheeling it based on how I know to do the job. It wasn't like I was using modules or anything. And like I said he had done the training so he knew like how cash management and stuff worked, but I was more explaining like when to do what things and like the flow of the store.  


Anyways, I really loved training him and I realized I miss training newbies. I've trained like 7 green beans and I almost always love the experience I have with them. 2 of my trainees have become Shift Supervisors and pretty quickly too. And I'm super proud of both of them. One of them was a gifted almighty natural and took to everything so quick. The other struggled and I coached her and continued to coach her and she got better and better and better. And she always told me what a great teacher I was. She is such a ray of light and I know some of her past and getting that promotion I know meant a lot to her. Also, I have to say I love being on more of my own schedule when I'm training. It feels nice to have more control of your time at work.  
Anyways now that I'm a shift I know its super rare to have me train new hires. And honestly, the experience I had training a shift this week was really great.

4388,0,"Former partner here. I was employed in 2016, promoted in late 2018 until I was separated as a SSV in 2020 without probable cause (HR is no help), returned in 2021 as a barista thinking I could start all over and quit the same year because I realized this life is behind me now. I put off my education because I was so invested in moving up the latter. I only hung out with coworkers and I constantly thought and spoke about Starbucks in social settings. My friends that didn’t work for the company found it very annoying.

One year later, I am a different person. I have a 4.0 gpa in college, employed at a local coffee shop making more tips and better hours, and more importantly, my relationship with my close friends that never worked for the BUX improved immensely. There are times where I do miss working for the company and the few good customers that made it a positive experience, but I remind myself of how horrible of a time it was while working there. 

My current job, we are required to sign an NDA to prevent any sort of workplace hostility such as gossiping about coworkers. I cannot tell you how fantastic it is that I work with people that do not form cliques, talk about each other, and support each other regardless of their skill set on the job. We know we signed a contract and we can get fired if we spoke badly about one another, but it subconsciously influenced us to see the good in each other instead of finding a trait that bothers us towards each other. Having a positive work environment without any animosity truly does improve your well-being and mentality overall.

To all the baristas out there, you are all doing a great job. I understand that most people who move up do not deserve to be in the positions they’re in, but try to overcome it and prevent engaging in any sort of negative interactions with other baristas, SSVs, SMs and even DMs. We all hate the cliques, gossiping, the unsupportive behavior, nepotism, favoritism and horrible customers, but remember YOU are wonderful as a person. Don’t let Starbucks consume you and make it your personality, it will hold you back and possibly fall into a depression like I did. Go in, do your job, and go home. North Star? Third place? Customer connection? Do the bare minimum. The company can care less about you and replace you in an instant, so as I said, don’t let it become you. If you need the job, then stay. If you want to move up, that is also good too, just remember who you are deep down inside. Life outside of Starbucks is great. I am a lot happier leaving behind the toxicity that was prevalent within the company. You don’t have to be like me and leave to be happy, but I’m just sharing my experience. If you have great partners, a store manager, and district manager, consider yourself lucky because I see that as a rare occurance, cherish it. Nevertheless, do what makes you happy regardless.

I need some help in figuring out a drink best for me. I LOVE the vanilla sweet cream cold brew with extra sweet cream, but the cold brew coffee is too strong for me and I am lactose intolerant. I’ve been ignoring the effects it has on me because I love the taste of the drink so much but I’m working on making better health decisions (I can’t stop drinking coffee quite yet though)

4466,0,"I'm still fairly new. I've only worked part time for about a month now. I feel like I haven't been fully utilizing my markouts. I want to get as much as I can because I feel like I'm leaving money, or food, on the table. And that only goes back to benefit a big corporation. Anyway, I usually come in 15 min before my shift and get a free coffee. After working, I usually get a free sandwich and iced tea. So, that's two free drinks and one food markout. I know they say we get three free drinks per shift. Is that other free drink only accessible during my shift/on my break? Can I get my free coffee before my shift and then two free drinks when I leave? 

Okay, then food markouts. We get seven food markouts a week. I usually only work four days a week. I've worked three days this week and go in tomorrow, Sunday. Like I said I usually only get a sandwich or other food item everytime I work. That's three food markouts I've used this week. I should have four left. Does that mean tomorrow I can go home with four free food items? And how do I do that? I've bought more than one food item before and when I select ""Partner Food"", it only applies it to one item then charges me discount price for the other items. On the POS, do I have select each item in the order and apply Partner Food? Or do I have to do separate transactions for each item and apply Partner Food on each transaction? 

Last question (I know I've gone on long)... food markouts on days we're not working. My SM briefly explained it to me when I was hired but I didn't understand fully how it worked. I think she said we can only mark out food on days we work. If we plan to come in on our day off, we could mark out a food for that day. How does that work? For example, I know I will want a blueberry muffin on my day off. Do I just mark out a blueberry muffin then come in on my day off and tell the barista working I already marked out a muffin?

I’ve been working at starbucks for about a month and 2 weeks, including training. I’m still struggling a lot. It’s a combination of things that are making me feel behind, but if I had to simplify it then I’d say it’s a mix of subpar training and my natural tendency to be bad at details. 

I trained at a different store because there were a lot of new hires. A lot of the training was online. I was able to practice a bit of CS and P.O.S. and I only got about 2 days on bar. There were a lot of things I was only told or shown once very quickly with little to no practice that I had a hard time remembering. 

I was lucky enough to get retrained for 3 more days after a few weeks of a lot of mistakes, and I feel a lot better with the job. The only issue is that now everyone knows me as an anxious mess so I’m not well respected. Some people are nice but others don’t give me the benefit of the doubt anymore. I feel more secure in my knowledge of the job now because I had a chance to ask all my questions, and get told all the rules and terms I didn’t even know existed up until that point. But I’m still working on speed and accuracy. I generally am bad with nit picky details. So even when I know what to do I mess up a lot, particularly on POS. (eg. accidentally charging for milk when you shouldn’t, accidentally scanning RTDNE items twice)

So, one of my shifts is really fed up with me. She’s new to the store and is a very detail oriented person. Knows how to do her job fairly well since she’s been at it for so long but in my opinion has difficulty with in the moment improvisation, which I feel is equally important. I feel like much of the time things inevitably can go wrong or slower than expected but she typically struggles to adapt to it and gets visibly frustrated. In moments like this she struggles with multitasking and lacks the ability to give clear instructions while she’s doing other things. Most people don’t get in any trouble for it because they already know how to do their jobs even without her instruction and have a reputation for being good at what they do already. 

She’s definitely more by the book than my other shifts. She always picks up on the little details I miss and gets really upset with me. Sometimes she feels guilty and starts being nice out of nowhere, but ultimately always falls back on getting openly fed up with me for something or another. Even off the floor she thinks I’m incompetent and doesn’t trust that I have any common sense. She doubts most things that I say even while we’re having small talk. And hasn’t asked me for permission before keeping me late twice now. Whenever something is off I’m the first person she blames for it. I get that sometimes I get anxious and have trouble doing the job completely correctly but she doesn’t respect me as a person. She’s open to other people about how much I hold her back and I feel like if I can’t do my job perfectly in the next few days she’s going to try to get me fired. She openly can’t stand me and looks exasperated just being around me. She’s right to be upset, there are a lot of things she’s had to tell me to do multiple times that I blatantly can’t remember or get right. But I feel completely and utterly disrespected by her in general and I think she truly has a problem with me. 

That said, do shifts have a lot of authority over who gets let go or at least in a lot of trouble? 

If you asked my other coworkers or shifts then they probably wouldn’t think I’m very competent either. But when my other shifts notice me make mistakes they are way more forgiving or able to improvise with it as it happens even if they are frustrated for a second. 

So yeah I keep making small detail oriented mistakes. More examples would be queueing shots before milk.. fumbling with cash.. being slow on CS.. asking if they want sweetener for the wrong drinks… not putting names on every order… 

I understand that my mistakes slow down the rest of the floor and I feel truly remorseful for it. But I feel like no matter how much I try to write down and retain, my inability to be detail oriented always comes around. I can’t stop messing up.

Lady pulled up and orders a decaf ice coffee. So I explain that we do not sell decaf iced coffee, but we can do a decaf iced americano instead. This is how the conversation went:

Me: we can do the iced americano for you instead!

Her: is that espresso?

Me: Yup, it's made with decaf espresso and water, so it tastes just like a coffee.

Her: But it's espresso.

Me: yup!

Her: so it had caffeine 

Me: well it has a tiny bit of caffeine, but just like a regular decaf coffee has a little caffeine. But it IS decaf.

Her: but it's espresso. 

Me: yes. 

Her: and espresso has caffeine.

Me: No, it would be made with DECAF espresso. So it IS espresso. But it's DECAF espresso. So it will be decaf.

Her: ...

Me: did you want to do that?

Her: yeah.

Me: what size?

Her: tall

Me: and anything in that...? Sweetener? Any kind of milk?

Her: light heavy cream.

Me: anything else? ^no *total*

Then she gets to the window and the bar partner has by mistake made it hot. *Remade* then she said is tastes wrong. But won't clarify what tastes wrong about it. Then finally the DTR figures out that she's is mad that the heavy cream is mixed in. So we remake is and CAREFULLY all pass it to the DTR partner trying not to wiggle it at all so the HEAVY MILK doesn't FOLLOW THE LAWS OF GRAVITY and mix in. 

She was in our DT for just shy or 13 minutes this morning during our Saturday peak. Bro. What? I am a very composed partner, but damn. Lady had me questioning if I know how words worked anymore. I CLEARLY used the word ""decaf"" 800 times. The DTO screen CLEARLY listed a DECAF iced americano. What is happening!!!??? Excuse me while I bang my head into the counter to make it end. 

Bonus story: had someone idle as the dt window for 12 minutes this morning before we opened. Car behind him, also waiting for the window, instead of... A parking spot? or even the order box? was there, idling 9 minutes to open, and then one more car at the speaker box 2 minutes to open.

I told her to tell her that our policy doesn’t allow us to do that. The most I can do is give her an empty cup so she can do it herself. My coworker was scared to tell her this and she asked me if I can do it. Mind you, this lady is already at the window and starring me down while I make her frap.

The chai pump is a lightning fast, extraordinarily powerful pump that takes wicked joy in showering upon any barista who dares go near it or god forbid- pump some into a cup for your 8$ drink in highly adhesive liquid. Unfortunately, a casualty was reported on this morn before the full rising of the sun. I pulled a sticker from the printer, it’s shears deciding my fate. I placed it upon a venti cold cup, and I quivered in my boots as I read “Vt Iced Chai Latte- 8 pumps chai”. I failed to swallow my fate come so soon, and shoved the cup under the dispenser to begin the perilous task of dealing with the rouge pump. I braced myself for the dreaded unwilling shower I was about to receive. I did not pull back my sorry head enough, and horrors! Horrors! Horrors! I felt a great sting in my eye, and a spray of chai- a violent jet of fury and sugar- spattered my face. Like a valiant soldier struck in battle, I carried on with my battles, dodging the fury and fire of my enemy the chai pump. My eye burned, and I felt my lashes clumping fast as he poured the milk and ice into the latte. I handed the drink off, my compensated kindness making my face vizard to my torments. My eye, now red with the perils of my work, was screaming for my attention. I retreat to the den of stock and the ocean of filth, to nurse my wounds.

I’m trying to find options for caffeinated beverage that I can stand the taste of. My college campus has a Starbucks so I figure something there is my best shot. Here’s a run down of what I’ve tried so far. 

1. I like the idea of tea but no matter what I try it’s always too watery and weak. When brewing at home I experimented and got to 1 tea bag per 2oz of water before giving. The only success I’ve had is peach Snapple and that’s more like juice. 
2. I’ve found I like Starbucks chai lattes if I add an extra pump of chai. I’m interested in trying other tea lattes but I don’t think Starbucks has those so that’s not really relevant. 
3. I can’t stand the bitterness of coffee. Last fall I tried the apple pie latte (think that’s what it was called) and was optimistic because I love apple stuff but the bitterness off the coffee was too much. I tried a frappe, cookie crumble I think, and I could still taste the coffee too much. Honestly tasting the coffee at all will probably be too much. 


With all of this in mind, do any of you have recommendations for caffeinated drinks at Starbucks I can try?

Also, how terrible are “secret menu” items on baristas? Especially interested in hearing from any student workers on here who worked at their college’s Starbucks. I know there’s not an actual secret menu so just adding a bunch of stuff. I found some based off the chai drinks that could make for some nice variety but I don’t want to if it’s something that’s a pain in the butt for the person making it.

Any advice would be really appreciated. I don’t want to keep buying drinks I can’t stand to finish but really want to find some way to consume caffeine.

I as you will see I started working at Starbucks 2 weeks ago. So far enjoying it.

I think Starbucks is unique in the sense that our menu is very large and extensive and making all the drinks to the desired specifications is sometimes challenging.

I want to build a simulation game in which you can make all the drinks from start to finish—Starbucks drinks simulator /Studio.

The hot and the cold bar. the steps the works 

I think the existence of such a game will reduce the training time, and resources spent training and will be a quality of life improvement for baristas trying to learn! It will make us learn quickly so we can go through all the recipes and learn more quickly. New recipes can also be added quickly if training can be done quickly.

 If you guys know anyone in corporate who could give me some resources to make this, that would be awesome !!   
I know I am a very low-level person working in the company but I feel like I can help make this training process fun and intuitive. I Did this in a day imagine if I get the proper resources to build this complete game how much easy training will be and how fun it will be !!!  

This is just something that I thought of It's okay if you guys don't want to do it LOL this I did just for fun!

If you can guys know anyone in the software team that would be really awesome!   
If they want to integrate the above quiz into the OTT training and partner platform if they want the source code. I am willing to give that away as well. It would be an honor. I don't have access to it but I have watched videos on it! (licensed stores)",i made a starbuck mini-game to memorize drinkcodes,1661572406,"i made a starbuck mini-game to memorize drinkcodes link-

4610,0,"I see a lot of posts about “service dogs” and ESAs and general pets in Starbucks. 

PETS AND ESAS ARE NOT ALLOWED. 
SERVICE DOGS ARE. 

We are allowed to ask two questions; whether the dog is a service dog and what tasks they are trained for aiding in a disability. You CANNOT ask about the disability (visible or not) and you CANNOT require the dog to wear a vest or be visibly identified as a service dog, ask them to perform a task, require the handler to present paperwork confirming the dog is a service animal OR about their disability (the list goes on and you can read more on the website I linked)

Generally, many service dogs will be wearing vests or be visibly identifiable as a service dog. But again, NOT REQUIRED. They are also not required to be on a leash ONLY IF the tasks they are trained for require the dog to be off leash (ex. getting help if the handler faints or has a medical spell, retrieving items, etc etc). 

Please do not get yourself or your store into legal trouble for not following the law. You CAN legally ask those who are not in control of their dogs to leave, especially if they decide to treat a cafe floor as a restroom. Be assertive but try not to escalate the situation.

The store I interviewed at and got hired for is in-between store managers right now, so there’s a “floating” manager there and a store manager from another location nearby helping this store out (that’s who interviewed/hired me).

Is it possible the offer letter lists the other location because the manager who’s hiring me is from that location but is hiring for this other location (the one I planned on being at), so she will transfer my account over to this location in the system?

at this store, we usually close in pairs, so you could probably imagine how the entire shift went. near silence the whole time unless i was asking her a question or she was (very seldomly) telling me what to do. it kind of surprised me that she yelled at me one point saying ""you can't just turn off the expresso machine!"" i...wasn't? i was just pressing the rinse button...? and even still, that's no reason to raise your voice like that. honestly, one time is enough and i really don't want to be paired with her for another 5-7 hour shift. i just want to learn and make drinks for people without being anxious or being treated like irritating dead weight."

4688,0,"So today I came in for my mid to close shift and nothing was done, we were down to two partners in the store, that’s including the shift atm, and they get off thirty minutes after I get on. For the rest of the day it was going to be a two partner play. Annoying, but not my first time dealing with it and I know it won’t be the last. No biggie, I thought, I get through it. Fast forward to about 4pm and I get a call from my closer that they’re sick(vomiting, headache). I tell them send a message in the group chat and see if anyone can cover the shift, and I’ll ask the partner on shift if they can. They inform me that they already asked 20ish minutes ago. I tell her to give our sm a text or call and let them know the situation. 20 minutes go by and I get a text message from my sm to call them. So, I’m assuming they’re about to let me know if we’ll have to close earlier since they is no closer. I let my partner know that I have to give our sm a quick call. I step to the BOH and do just that while trying to make a dent in the massive pile of dishes we have. Whenever my sm picks up they ask me what’s the situation with the partner who texted/called them. Confusingly, I tell them that they can’t come in. They then proceeds to ask what steps I have taken, and I tell them. They then asks me to describe my thought process and how I utilized the ACT model. Annoyingly, I tell them again what I did(asked the partner to message the group, asked partner on shift) they then tell me the partner should not have texted/called them and that I should have called around to other stores before coming to them. I proceed to tell them that we are slammed, I only have one other partner on the floor, and a backlog of task I need to do and I didn’t have time to look up other store numbers and ask if they have any partners that could close for us. They then proceeds to say that I make 20$ a hour and I need to own it(this is the comment I’m concerned about) that they have coverage for me, and asked me to assure them that I will better utilize the ACT model. Annoyed and not willing to fight it since I have a full lobby and need to get back out on the floor, agree and we both hang up. 
Later on the partner who called out calls again and asks what was going on since apparently our sm didn’t bother to respond or call them back. 

All while having this conversation they had a very clearly annoyed tone to their voice. 

My question is, is this something that I should bring to hr or my dm? 
I’ve been with the company almost 4 years now and I’ve never had any issues with any sm with situations like this up until now.
To me it sounded like they were saying that I need to earn my wage which to me comes off as them using our recent pay raise against me which feels unethical.",possible unethical comment from sm not sure if i should talk to my dm or hr about it.,1661485255,"possible unethical comment from sm not sure if i should talk to my dm or hr about it. so today i came in for my mid to close shift and nothing was done, we were down to two partners in the store, that's including the shift atm, and they get off thirty minutes after i get on. for the rest of the day it was going to be a two partner play. annoying, but not my first time dealing with it and i know it won't be the last. no biggie, i thought, i get through it. fast forward to about 4pm and i get a call from my closer that they're sick(vomiting, headache). i tell them send a message in the group chat and see if anyone can cover the shift, and i'll ask the partner on shift if they can. they inform me that they already asked 20ish minutes ago. i tell her to give our sm a text or call and let them know the situation. 20 minutes go by and i get a text message from my sm to call them. so, i'm assuming they're about to let me know if we'll have to close earlier since they is no closer. i let my partner know that i have to give our sm a quick call. i step to the boh and do just that while trying to make a dent in the massive pile of dishes we have. whenever my sm picks up they ask me what's the situation with the partner who texted/called them. confusingly, i tell them that they can't come in. they then proceeds to ask what steps i have taken, and i tell them. they then asks me to describe my thought process and how i utilized the act model. annoyingly, i tell them again what i did(asked the partner to message the group, asked partner on shift) they then tell me the partner should not have texted/called them and that i should have called around to other stores before coming to them. i proceed to tell them that we are slammed, i only have one other partner on the floor, and a backlog of task i need to do and i didn't have time to look up other store numbers and ask if they have any partners that could close for us. they then proceeds to say that i make 20$ a hour and i need to own it(this is the comment i'm concerned about) that they have coverage for me, and asked me to assure them that i will better utilize the act model. annoyed and not willing to fight it since i have a full lobby and need to get back out on the floor, agree and we both hang up.
later on the partner who called out calls again and asks what was going on since apparently our sm didn't bother to respond or call them back.
all while having this conversation they had a very clearly annoyed tone to their voice.

They always single me out for these things, take me to the back, and think reading Starbucks pamphlets to me about our ""mission/values"" will some how make my brain neurotypical or something. like, how is asking a customer, when vanilla is out, ""we're out of vanilla right now, do you want to try caramel instead, or something similar?"" rude??? just because I don't have a woman's voice and can't go high and fluctuate means I'm not being positive? it's such bullshit. and then I also had to spill I have autism and that reading people and normal socializing is incredibly hard for me.

We alternated between being watched over by an ASM-in-training, an SM-in-training, and an SM of another store in our district that was training to be DM. Despite this, I was assured multiple times that my transfer would be completed in time for me to move. 

That didn't happen, though. To this day, I'm still in the system as working at my old store. I bothered the shit out of everyone I could think of, hoping that *someone* could help me transfer, but to no avail. I was told that since my old store doesn't officially have an SM, no one has ""access""  to transfer me except the DM, who seems either unable or unwilling to.

To make matters worse, the SM at my new store told me that I would start this week but I've only worked two shifts so far and I'm currently not scheduled *at all* for this week, next week, or the week after. My new SM says he'll fix it, but that was a couple of days ago and nothing's changed. I texted him again earlier today and haven't heard anything back.

I'm really fucking stressed about it and don't know what to do. My new store is low-volume and cafe-only, so I'm scared that there just isn't enough room to fit me into the schedule. I'm also scared that my new SM is already sick of dealing with me and doesn't want me to work at his store anymore.

I'm not really in the position where I can afford to not work for 2-3 weeks/indefinitely. I honestly really enjoy working at Starbucks - the pay is decent compared to similar jobs, getting off at 11 or 12 is really convenient as a college student, and I'm good at my job.

4726,0,"Hi, I’ve been officially hired by Starbucks since 7/25 of this year, I didn’t begin my actual training until a few weeks later and now this is my final week of training. 

Originally, I inquired about getting a job at Starbucks because there’s a billion of them everywhere. I was scheduled to move in December of this year, and it would’ve been an easy job to pickup in my new town. Now, my move is coming much sooner. My S/O was expecting a move with a new big-girl office job later in the year (December) but now it’s happening in October, before my 3 months are finished at Starbucks. 

I was curious what my options are? I’m scared to bring any of this up to my SM or anyone in case of any type of ill-will or retaliation of some sort. My store is very understaffed and several other partners made it clear I was being rushed through training. I also of course do feel bad ditching them so soon especially since everyone there has been incredibly nice to me. Idk if Starbucks as a corporation will see me as a waste of their time and decide I’m not reliable enough to rehire. 

Should I tell my SM about my new life changes? Should I put in my 2-weeks a week or two before my 3 months have finished? What issues would this cause for me? Would I have to start training all over again at a new store in my new city? Would Starbucks even hire me again after this?

I’m very curious and want to handle this the most professional, courteous way. But I can’t change anything about this move to a completely other part of the country.

4733,0,"I was at an Sbux inside a grocery store recently and wanted a latte for while I shopped. I ordered my usual - venti iced latte with hazelnut and oat milk if you have it. The lady kinda gave me a quizzical look and said “oh, you want the shaken oat milk espresso?” I said no, just a latte will be fine, no shaking needed. Again, weird look, then she went to make it. 

I picked it up and immediately knew something was off. The syrup was sitting at the bottom of the drink, not incorporated at all, and the drink overall just ended up tasting weird. I’m still not sure what it was but it didn’t taste at all like a latte usually does from any other store.

So my question is - should I have just accepted that she wanted to make me a shaken espresso drink? Did she *try* to make the espresso drink instead of my latte and it didn’t work out because yknow they’re different drinks? I’m just curious as to what happened to make it so…..bleh.

i don't know, i'm just tired and angry of this nonsense."

Last Friday, we had a super busy evening and the urns were all in the middle of getting urnexed by someone who went home sick. The Karen came in and ordered her usual, I make a pour over because I don’t want to risk poisoning her with urnex because we have no idea what point in the cleaning routine any of the urns are at. I went heavier than she’d liked with the cream and she asked me to top it off with more coffee. I tell her we don’t have any brewed so I can either remake it if she’d like or add a shot. She got really pissed off, said “No, thank you” and stormed off and literally *threw her fucking drink all over all the cafe trashes*. At this point in my head I’m worried she’s gonna go home and call corporate, my coworkers are shocked. I tried to be accommodating, we had no usable urns, and all I could do was either redo the pour over or add a shot like I offered. Thought that encounter was over with, but she came through my drive thru tonight and ordered the cream and sugar on the side.

4816,0,"Hi there! Something happened today that made me feel a little weird about my drink order. For reference, my mom has ordered her green tea frap this same way for years, so that’s where I got it from.

My order has been a caramel Frappuccino w/ extra ice, extra caramel, double blended &amp; in a venti cup. 

Usually I’ll order and I don’t get any feedback and if I’m at a new Starbucks I preface it by saying I have a complicated order just in case. I don’t order if the line is long and I never complain if it’s not in a venti cup. I do not expect the cup to be full. I do expect to be charged for extra caramel. If there was a charge for the cup, I have paid that, too. I work in retail so my ice melts in the back room while I’m assisting guests. The extra ice helps my drink last a while longer. 

Today I ordered and after reading back my order, I asked the barista if she heard me ask for a venti cup. It flashed on the screen a couple of times like she couldn’t find the right button, so when she told me to pull up, I didn’t think anything of it. When I get to the window, it’s in a grande cup. I didn’t complain or anything but after reading a bit here I am wondering if that was intentional? 

I don’t want to be a bad customer. Can I make this less annoying for them? Should I go drop off some chocolates for being annoying? Idk??

4841,0,"How long does ethics give decision after the investigation?

This will be a pretty long story/rant. Please try to understand as English is not my first language 

2 partners filed an ethics complaint plus 2 incident reports (a witness report and a green bean) against the same SSV.

SSV apparently called a partner from a minority a slave. Partner reported the incident to the manager but manager just shrugged the incident off and even told the partner to not tell it to other partners as manager is afraid that other partners will get mad at ssv and will bully ssv. We already knew that this SSV and SM are particularly close and lets SSV gets away from any complaints. Instead of giving SSV corrective action or coaching for the racism issue, SM nitpicks on the partner for every little thing even some things aren't true. There was also a second time with the same partner where SSV asked if partner lives on a gh**to area. Partner also reported the incident but nothing was done. So we convinced partner to call ethics instead. Partner was able to talk to the DM before they moved to another province. Partner later found out that our SM called the store sm that they're going to transfer to and said bad things about partner to prevent partner from being accepted to the store.

Another ethics complaint and 2 IR are related.
SSV aggressively followed a green bean from inside the store to the parking lot and yelled at green bean in front of many customers and partners which I feel is against third place policy and anti-harassment. Even though green bean didn't notify ssv (which SSV IS hardly on the floor working) that GB clocked out, SSV should just coach GB properly. GB told the incident to SM but blamed GB instead on how GB is being inconsiderate and non-cooperative. GB told another SSV about what happened and felt it was unfair so they filed a complaint for GB. GB and other witnesses also filed incident reports which notified our SM and it pissed our SM off. The investigation started 2 weeks ago where DM asked people who filed the ir and complaints as well as other baristas.


  Many partners also talked to SSV and SM directly on how SSV is being aggressive and acting like a bully to other partners(especially green beans) instead of coaching them properly but nothing happens to ssv instead SM nitpicks/blames partners who complains about SSV and sometimes would cut their hours.


TL;DR 
Partners filed ethics complaints and incident reports against the same SSV for racism and being a bully towards green beans. Partners tried to have a talk several times with SSV and SM for the aggressive behavior but no corrective action is taken and SM is always covering up SSV.  Investigation was started 2-3 weeks ago and partners are losing hope that the results will still fall into SSV's favor.

This wasn't a term you'd find in the employee handbook--not an officially sanctioned term.

Ex-partner x2 here. I worked at Starbucks 2013-2018, then Mar 2021 - Oct 2021 before landing (what I thought was) a more stable full time job. 

Spoiler alert: it was not.

Now I’m thinking about returning to Starbucks. I will say, I definitely enjoyed my time during my first five years more than I enjoyed it this last time. With the recipe changes, new policies, COVID, it wasn’t my favorite - plus I was starting at an EXTREMELY high volume store for our area, and they didn’t really train me again because I’d spent five years with the company previously. (Which is whatever, but things had changed, so it would’ve been nice to know them beforehand and not told them while doing something wrong on the floor.)

I don’t think the pay has changed for every store in my area, though. Last year, I was making $13 for the few months I spent as a SSV, but I know they were talking about raising pay. I see barista postings on indeed around here from $10-$15 an hour, so who knows. 

But I’m only making $16 now, they’re cutting my hours, and I’m considering moving back to the bux and working my way up this time. As long as I can find a location around me paying at least $15.

SO. Baristas and SSVs of Reddit, how are we liking it nowadays? I know the company is under a lot of fire for the union stuff, but as a day to day job, how are we feeling? Pros/cons? Advice? Etc?

4984,0,"So today our store got a spontaneous call that another store was short staffed and in need of any free baristas. I volunteered and headed over. To my surprise, I ended up solo handling register, bar, and food warming for about an hour. There was a steadily growing line of customers and it was pretty stressful. There was a shift manager doing who the heck knows what? I asked them to help me make drinks at one point. They literally picked up a cup, put a sticker on it, and said they had to “handle” something. Surprisingly all the customers were patient and many of them said “I was working very hard.” I even got a large tip from a kind customer. It was just a genuinely crazy experience. I jokingly told a shift manager from my own store and she said that “that was not okay treatment for me to have received.”",i soloed the entire floor,1661210530,"i soloed the entire floor so today our store got a spontaneous call that another store was short staffed and in need of any free baristas. i volunteered and headed over. to my surprise, i ended up solo handling register, bar, and food warming for about an hour. there was a steadily growing line of customers and it was pretty stressful. there was a shift manager doing who the heck knows what? i asked them to help me make drinks at one point. they literally picked up a cup, put a sticker on it, and said they had to ""handle"" something. surprisingly all the customers were patient and many of them said ""i was working very hard."" i even got a large tip from a kind customer. it was just a genuinely crazy experience. i jokingly told a shift manager from my own store and she said that ""that was not okay treatment for me to have received."""

like i understand maybe doing it when there’s a rush (i’m DEF guilty) but even then, if you’re quick with it, using the shakers really doesn’t take more time than putting it all in the cup.

at my old stores it was taboo to do it but now everyone gives me the side eye when i actually use the shakers and it’s like. yall. i’m NOT the weird one here. pls.

But after starting this new job I haven’t had the same availability and things are so hectic as I’m through training. I know my schedule will change in my new job once training is done, but my starbucks store says they can’t just have 1 day availability. I know they can because my old store has someone who only works 1 shift. But since I’m in this ultimatum, it’s a choice between $17 an hour with part time hours, or $29 an hour with full time hours. Hmm 🤔 which one makes more sense?
