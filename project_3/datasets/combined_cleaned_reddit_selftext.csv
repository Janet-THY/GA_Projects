i've been making sure to properly clean the drains for months even tho it's almost impossible because we have sewage backup constantly and half of our drains are so stopped up that theres no room to pour any cleaner in them without it immediately coming back up!
and they keep understaffing us. my manager told me today ""labor looks a little high today send someone home"" because it was raining and we had less customers than usual. this would've finally been the time to get some of us deep cleaning the store! but no. labor percentage is more important than helping to control our fruit fly infestation ....

103,1,"who should i call about a two month long, (yearly recurring) fruit fly infestation? i'm a shift leader at a dunkin. we have a fruit fly infestation every summer. most of the time it's because the air conditioning breaks every year, and we have to choose between sweating to death or opening the back door for flies to come in.
this year, however, they fixed the ac on july (because the district manager had to actually spend time in the store to train a new manager so she finally saw that it was 95 fahrenheit in here and decided she should do something because she's suffering)
anyways we haven't been keeping the back door open but we still have a lot of fruit flies. we all know about it. but nobody will do anything about it. i've tried to have the crew clean like crazy but they keep only putting 3 people on for days and we literally don't even get time to take breaks (even though my manager keeps taking the breaks out of our paycheck)
so we can't clean...not even at night bc they keep complaining about labor so day crew has to vanish as soon as their shift is over and we can't clean up so night crew has to clean our mess.
every now and then i try to clean out the drains but most of the drains are so filled with stuff that they don't even drain. this is something thats also been a problem for years.
the thing that threw me over the edge today was finding a fruit fly crawling on sandwich station. it immediately made me want to close the store down. and then...i found one in the coffee cup i was preparing. just drowning in the cream.
i know that the only way anything will happen is if someone calls someone outside of the store to do something about it. because they've been known about it and haven't done anything besides get 1 trap like 2 months ago....
my manager said ""we have to get really good with cleaning"" but we're literally trying our best but they won't staff us!
and i ain't never seen her pick up a broom.

i have done research to find out what types of questions i can expect to receive during the interview. below is a list of possible questions and the answers i have drafted. i will gladly accept any feedback. it is doubtful that every single one of these questions would be asked, but some of them will and i don't know which ones will and which ones won't be asked, so i need to be prepared. please focus not on how likely it is that i will be asked these questions, but on whether or not the answers i have drafted would make sense had these questions been asked.
**what are your strengths**?
i am a quick learner. i am enthusiastic and hungry to learn. furthermore, i take criticism really well. if i have done something wrong, i want to be told what i did wrong. therefore, you will never have to worry about me making the same mistake twice.
**what is your biggest weakness**?
with what little work experience i have, i am a work in progress. however, being so new to this profession, i can be shaped into the perfect employee.
**what are your career goals**?
at the moment, i am in a discovery phase. in an attempt to find myself, i want a job that will remind me about the value of hard work and enable me to challenge myself. i hope to be able to multitask, so that i may learn, grow and develop.
**where do you see yourself five years from now**?
five years from now, i plan to still be working here. hopefully, i will have contributed to the company enough to be seen as a trusted and reliable member of my team. while still in the ame role, i would have a wide range of responsibilities. i would be the go to person for advice and expertise in my area.
**when are you available to work**?
i am available to work anytime.
**tell me about yourself**.
there is so much to tell, it is hard to know where to begin.
in undergrad, i completed an internship working on nightly and weekend programming. this job enabled me to work with students who had learning disabilities. i would help to coordinate events. i would help with the set up and clean up. during the event itself, i would interact with the students and ensure that they were having a good time and obeying all school rules. if i am hired to work at dunkin donuts, it would be my job to ensure that the customers have a pleasant experience.
**walk me through your resume**.
i have done landscaping jobs before. i once shovelled snow out of the driveway of a customer who was unable to shovel himself due to back problems. i was self-employed and the pay was not steady. i had to seek out opportunities for work. i did not have the same sense or order that i would have at a job that takes place in a building where i punch in and punch out. that is why i would like a job like this, where i am told when to show up and what to do when i am here.
i recently finished school. my major was psychology. i knew that the courses that i took in school were no guarantee of figuring out what i wanted to do with my life. however, by understanding human nature, i would be able to better understand the world, which would help me connect with people and figure out how to find work.
my last semester of undergrad, i worked an unpaid internship on nightly and weekend programming for the thames program. the thames program at mitchell college is a program for students with learning disabilities. i assisted with the prep work, set up and cleaned up for many events. during these events, i would interact with and act as a role model for younger students. as an intern, there was a degree of creativity involved with the job, but for the most part, i followed orders given to me by my supervisor. i foresee this job as one that is mostly about obeying an employer. i intend to set up the place to open and/or clean up the place before leaving after closing.
**how did you hear about this job**?
i received an email notification from indeed.com. i like challenges. this job is physically demanding, because you have to lift objects that weigh as much as 35 pounds. the job is also socially challenging, you must greet customers and ensure that people have a pleasant experience when the people in question are complete strangers and you do not know what they like. this job sounds challenging in a good way. this job sounds exactly like a challenging task i have been looking for this whole time.
**why do you want to work at this company**?
i want to work at dunkin donuts, because the clientele is very diverse and should provide an opportunity to meet new people and learn new things.
this restaurant's target demographic is the working class. these are the people who come here to get a coffee and a sausage egg and cheese sandwich right before work. i take great joy in my genuine desire to make life easier or more convenient for the average american.
**why should we hire you**?
my biggest strength and potential contribution to the company would have to be that i am a team player. in a restaurant staff, it is expected that we, as workers, take care of our own and put the needs of the customers first. having majored in behaviour science in undergrad, i have learned how to get along with people and work as a team. when i did community service for sacred heart school in taftville, i would be assigned a task and expected to do it under a time constraint, as the cafeteria was supposed to be used by someone else for something else at an allotted time. therefore, i know how to not only do a good job, but complete a job by a strict deadline. also, i was a student-athlete in high school. from this experience, i built up stamina and learned to multi-task.
**when did you have to work under stress? how did you handle it**?
when i completed an internship in undergrad, i had to complete 100 hours by the end of the semester. i dealt with that stress the same way i dealt with any other form of stress, by using the one year rule. if ever i am stressed about anything, i simply ask myself, will this still be on my mind in a year? if the answer is no, then logically there is no reason to be worried, as it will all blow over in 365 days or less. if, however, the answer is yes, then there is still no reason to be worried, as even if things do not go as planned, there will be plenty more opportunities to rectify what went wrong. i also ask myself this one question. what is the worst thing that can happen? stress is what you feel when you are not sure what the outcome will be and you know that the outcome could be undesirable. when you take a driving test, you feel stressed, because you might not pass. if you ask yourself what the worst thing that can happen is, you may be surprised to discover that the worst thing that can happen is not only pretty unlikely to happen in the first place, if it were to happen, it would not be that bad.
**do you prefer to work alone or as part of a team**?
i like to work as part of a team. i also enjoy working alone with close supervision. when i did my internship in college, i would interact with my supervisors, the other interns and my teacher. it was all up to me to ensure that i fulfilled my responsibilities. i was supervised in regards to the jobs that i did for the school, but it was my responsibility to ensure that my work was completed in time.
**how would you deal with a conflict**?
if ever i dealt with a conflict, whether it be work related or inter personal, i would say to the other person the following;
""it seems to me that you are upset or angry that something has been done wrong. would you please tell me what i have done wrong, why it was wrong and what, if anything, can be done to improve the situation?""
that is verbatim what i would say in response to a complaint.
**how would you remain motivated in your work**?
i consistently ask myself; am i a better person than i was a year ago? and what do i need to do to become better over the course of the next 365 days? i think of it in terms of years, not days. everyone has bad days. you don't know if you will improve from one day to the next, but there is no excuse for regressing from one year to the next.
**what is your ideal working environment**?
my ideal working environment is one where everyone makes it a priority to build others up. no one is perfect. when a fellow worker makes a mistake, the appropriate response is to either correct the mistake or teach the person who made the mistake to correct it himself or herself. this expectation should apply in all directions, employee toward employer, employer toward employee and employee toward other employee.
**is there anything you have done in the past that you wish you had done differently**?
when i did community service for sacred heart school, i was tasked with vacuuming the carpets. i unplugged the vacuum cleaner before turning it off. i received a shock.
**if you have a day when you are not busy, what would you do**?
i would ask my supervisor if anything else needs to be done, hoping he or she has a task for me.
**why is it important for all policies and standards to be obeyed**?
policies, procedures and standards are set in place with the intent to work toward a common goal. if some people in a staff or faculty disobey policies, a common goal will never be achieved.
**when can you start? when are you available**?
i am capable of beginning immediately. i am available to work any shift.
**are you able to travel**?
although i do not have my own vehicle, i will have transportation for scheduled shifts.
**do you have any experience working in fast food**?
i do not.
**why are you interested in working with us**?
i am a regular customer of dunkin donuts. every product, the donuts, coffee, hot chocolate, and breakfast sandwiches are amazing. i am impressed by the quality of the products, not to mention the customer service. if i work here, i can spread joy through a cup of coffee and make customers loyal to the brand. furthermore, the fast paced environment is my ideal workplace.
**what do you know about the company**?
when william rosenberg founded dunkin donuts in 1950, the company first did business in quincy massachusetts. the slogan ""america runs on dunkin"" is accurate. it is the most popular coffee seller in the country, measured by the number of coffee cups sold. dunkin donuts sells over 2 billions cups of coffee in a single calendar year.
**why us and not our competitors**?
as a loyal customer of dunkin donuts, i know that dunkin donuts produces products of much higher quality at a lower price compared to other companies. year after year, dunkin donuts has not dropped in quality at all. the clientele is very diverse and should provide an opportunity to meet new people and learn new things. this restaurant's target demographic is the working class. these are the people who come here to get a coffee and a sausage egg and cheese sandwich right before work. i take great joy in my genuine desire to make life easier or more convenient for the average american.
**why should we hire you**?
my biggest strength and potential contribution to the company would have to be that i am a team player. in a restaurant staff, it is expected that we, as workers, take care of our own and put the needs of the customers first. having majored in behaviour science in undergrad, i have learned how to get along with people and work as a team. when i did community service for sacred heart school in taftville, i would be assigned a task and expected to do it under a time constraint, as the cafeteria was supposed to be used by someone else for something else at an allotted time. therefore, i know how to not only do a good job, but complete a job by a strict deadline. also, i was a student-athlete in high school. from this experience, i built up stamina and learned to multi-task.
**how would you deal with an unsatisfied customer**?
i would offer my condolences, ask why the experience was unpleasant and ask what, if anything, i am capable of doing to remedy the situation so that it never occurs again. if it is possible to fulfil the customer's request while obeying the rules set in place by my employer, i will do so.
**can you work under pressure**?
i can definitely work under pressure. pressure makes me a more competent worker. when i completed an internship in undergrad, the knowledge that i had to complete 100 hours of service by the end of the semester gave me the incentive i needed to reach out to people and ask if there were any favours they needed. when my professor told me that failure to complete 100 hours would result in an f for the course and course credit being withheld, i immediately knew that i needed to reach out and seek opportunities as soon as possible.
**what do you foresee being the biggest challenge at this job**?
i have always wanted to work here and never given much thought to the challenges that are likely to come up. i imagine i will face the typical challenges associated with a fast paced environment. i am sure that it will be nothing unsolvable. when i face a challenge or i am out of my comfort zone, there is no need to talk about how uncomfortable i am. my discomfort is my problem, no one else's. i will deal with the discomfort myself one time. when talking to others i will focus on the positive.
**what would you do if a customer asked to speak to the manager**?
i would first ask what the problem is and whether or not i can help. if i can help, i will. if, however, i lack the ability to solve the problem myself or the customer insists on seeing the manager, then i will get the manager immediately.
**how reliable are you**?
i pride myself in always showing up and time, doing my best and receiving all the constructive criticism that is useful to me. if i am unable to show up, i intend to give my employer and coworkers notice well in advance.
**how do you intend to provide excellent customer service**?
i will always provide service with a smile. in other words, have a positive perky attitude when greeting a customer. i will lead the customer to a seat for an in house order. to ensure that the customer is attended to in a timely manner, i will be sure to sit or stand in a location where i can easily identify a customer and a customer could easily identify me.
**what would you do if you caught a fellow employee stealing from the cash register**?
i do not tolerate unethical behaviour such as stealing. i will report the theft in such a way as standard procedure dictates. this is rarely an issue for me in the first place, as the vast majority of people who i have ever met have proper respect for other people's property.
**how do you achieve proper work-life balance**?
when i am not at work, i throw myself into my hobbies. i enjoy athletic activities like hiking, leisure activities like playing video games and intellectually stimulating activities such as reading classic novels and writing movie reviews.
**what would you do if a customer ordered in house and refused to pay**?
i hope i never have to deal with that, but should such an unfortunate circumstance arise, i would speak to security or management, who are trained to handle such situations.
**what have you done to better your understanding of this field in the last five years**?
in school, i took several classes in psychology and marketing. this taught me a lot about the economy, customer service, human nature and how to behave professionally.
**how would you prioritise tasks during a busy period**?
the customer always comes first.
if i am in the middle of setting a table and a party enters as the phone is ringing, i would drop what i am doing, escort the customer to their table, answer the phone and then finish setting the table in that order.
**how do you intend to blend with our existing team**?
i have pretty good communication and people skills. i respect people's boundaries. if the employee is more experienced than i am, i will look to him or her for guidance
**do you have any questions for me**? (this is what the interviewer will ask).

267,1,"consistently given iced coffee instead of cold brew? hi dunkin,
i have a dunkin' donuts near my place of work, where i pick up ""cold brews"" 2-5 times a week. i'm not a huge coffee snob, but i did work at dunkin in college, and can easily distinguish between cold brew and iced coffee. dunkin's iced coffee is much more bitter, more watered down, a slightly lighter color, and leaves bean dust floating in the bottom of your drink. cold brew, being around a dollar more, is higher quality and tastes better (imo).
so i guess here's where the snobbiness comes in... i can tell that i often get iced coffee in my ""cold brew"", and it quite honestly ruins my day. some days it's just straight undrinkable, or full of bean floaties, or an odd grayish color (presumably because it's watered down remaining iced coffee). i've tried clarifying that it is cold brew, i've tried asking the cashier if they still have cold brew before i order, i've even asked the barista which they used. i have never asked for a remake, and i'm really trying to avoid that, but i will lose my freaking mind if i wind up with another ""cold brew"" that tastes like coffee piss on ice.
when it comes down to it, if the cashier would honestly tell me that cold brew was out, i simply wouldn't buy it that day. i'm much more a starbucks gal, but this dunkin is the sole remaining covid survivor in my area. it's my only option for coffee i didn't make myself. i'm not trying to be an asshole, i definitely don't want to make the employees miserable..... but how on earth can i get them to be honest with me about the contents of the ""cold brew"", and is there any way to avoid a weekly gamble? is it okay to complain? is it fine to ask for a remake/ refund? i know i hated remaking drinks, but then again, i took the high road and told my customers when i was out of cold brew....
anyway, friendly reminder to all, customers can tell the difference when you sub in the cheaper products. if you're out of something, please be honest. if you mess up, please correct it. all i want is my cashier to honestly tell me when they're out of cold brew - that's it. but instead, i get constant promises that it is indeed cold brew.... and half the time, it's not.",1661277400,consist given ice coffe instead cold brew hi dunkin near place of work i pick cold brew 2 5 time a week i a huge coffe snob i work dunkin colleg easili distinguish cold brew and ice coffe dunkin ice coffe much bitter more water a slightli lighter color and leav bean dust float in bottom of drink cold brew around a dollar more is higher qualiti and tast better imo i guess s where the snobbi come in i can tell i often get ice coffe in my cold brew and quit honestli ruin my day day it s straight undrink full of bean floati or odd grayish color presum it s water down remain ice coffe i tri clarifi that it is cold brew i ve tri ask the cashier still have cold brew i order i ve even ask the barista they use i have never ask a remak and i m realli tri avoid that but i lose my freak mind if i wind up anoth cold brew that tast like coffe piss ice it come down to it if the cashier would honestli tell that cold brew i simpli buy it that day i m much more a gal but dunkin is the sole remain covid survivor in my area it s my option for coffe i t make i m not tri to an asshol i definit t want to make the employe miser but on earth can i get to be honest with me the content of the cold brew and is way to avoid a weekli gambl is it okay to complain is it fine to ask for a remak refund i know i hate remak drink but i took the high road and told my custom when i wa out of cold brew anyway friendli remind to custom can tell the differ when sub in the cheaper product if you out of someth pleas be honest if you mess up pleas correct it all i want is my cashier to honestli tell me when they re out of cold brew that s it but instead i get constant promis that it is inde cold brew and half the time it s not

415,1,"thinking about quitting this is just me ranting, but i'm losing my mind.
when i first started working at dunkin, i loved it. there were some hiccups, with me not quite being trained properly, but once i learned everything it was awesome. i liked my coworkers, hell i even liked my manager most days. we all worked well as a team and everything, for the most part, ran smoothly.
but then our manager quit , and they hired a new manager. although she claims to have prior experience as a dunkin manager, i swear to god she has no idea what she's doing. everyone here welcomed her and tried to help her adjust to the store (our store had been renovated recently so we had a few machines that were different to what she was used to), and she was great.. for a few days.
i had a week off for a vacation soon after she joined, and when i came back everything had gone to hell. i wish i was exaggerating when i say 75% of my coworkers had already quit, without even a 2 weeks notice. from what i heard over text, she wasn't listening to the hours people said they could work and was scheduling people when they weren't at all available, but then getting mad when they said they couldn't come in. a few times, she left a gap in the schedule where no one was scheduled to be in the store. the store, left completely unattended, for several hours. machines were breaking because she refused to learn how to use them properly. she'd come on the floor to ""help"", make a mess, and then leave and expect everyone else to clean it up. and in my experience since i've come back, it's all true. i've specifically said i cannot, under any circumstances, work opening shifts. last week she scheduled me for exclusively opening. i texted her, again, to tell her i couldn't, and she told me i had to ""figure it out and find someone to cover."" i switched with a girl who said she couldn't do closing shifts and only got closing shifts.
now that we're constantly understaffed, we're all just trying our best and, yes, we're taking shortcuts. shoot me, sometimes i'll make a latte right in the cup instead of putting it in the metal tin first. or i'll bounce between stations instead of sticking to one because we don't have enough people to staff every station! and when i'm closing i have to leave my coworker out on the floor by herself to go to the back to do closing chores because we don't have anyone else to help. but she is constantly nitpicking everything and saying it's ""not standard!!"" but it's literally the only way we can get through the day anymore.
i came in yesterday, and said hello to her on my way in. without even saying hello or good morning or anything, the first thing she said to me, at 6 in the fucking morning, was ""why did it take you more than 10 minutes to do boxes yesterday?"" it was truck day, i had literally an entire stores worth of supplies that we had unpacked from boxes, and all of those boxes had to be broken down. anyone who works at dunkin knows that is dozens of boxes, and most of them are too big to fit in the dumpster at all so they have to be cut and well broke down before they can be taken out. and that's not including the 2 minutes each way it takes to pull the trashcan to the dumpster, and you usually need at least 2-3 trips (if not more). and i told her all of this, and she said she didn't care, and that next time she caught me ""wasting time"" she'd suspend me.
the only thing keeping me here at this point is that almost no one in the area is hiring, and the very few people that are hiring are hiring for jobs that i am so not qualified for. but i swear i've never felt more mentally drained.",1660535299,think quit rant lose mind i first start work i love hiccup me quit train properli but i learn everyth it awesom i like my cowork hell i even like my manag day work well team everyth most part ran smoothli but manag quit and hire a new manag although claim prior experi as a dunkin manag i swear to god she idea she everyon welcom and tri to help her adjust to the store our store renov recent we had a machin were differ to what she wa use to and she wa great for a few day i had a week for a vacat soon she join and when i came back everyth had gone to hell i wish i wa exagger when i say 75 my cowork had alreadi quit without even a 2 week notic what i heard text she listen to the hour peopl said they could work and wa schedul peopl when they t at all avail but then get mad when they said they t come a few time she left a gap in the schedul no one wa schedul to in the store the store left complet unattend for sever hour machin were break she refus to learn to use properli she come the floor to help make a mess and then leav and expect everyon els to clean it and in my experi sinc i come back it s all true i ve specif said i cannot circumst work open shift last week she schedul me for exclus open i text her to tell her i couldn t and she told me i had to figur it and find someon to cover i switch with a girl said she couldn t close shift and got close shift that we constantli understaf we re all just tri our best and ye we re take shortcut shoot me sometim i make a latt right in the cup instead of put it in the metal tin first i ll bounc station instead of stick to one becaus we t have enough peopl to staff everi station and when i m close i have to leav my cowork out on the floor to go to the back to do close chore becaus we don t have anyon els to help but she is constantli nitpick everyth and say it s not standard but it s liter the onli way we get the day anymor i came in yesterday and said hello to her on my way in without even say hello or good morn or anyth the first thing she said to me at 6 in the fuck morn wa it take 10 minut to do box yesterday it wa truck day i had liter entir store worth of suppli that we had unpack from box and all of box had to be broken anyon who work at dunkin know that is dozen of box and most of them big to fit in the dumpster at all so they have to be cut and well broke down they can be taken out and that s not includ the 2 minut way it take to pull the trashcan to the dumpster and you usual need at least 2 3 trip not more and i told her all of thi and she said she t care and that next time she caught me wast time she d suspend me the onli thing keep me here at thi point is that almost no one in the area is hire and the few peopl that are hire are hire for job that i so not qualifi for but i swear i ve never felt more mental drain
416,1,"psa for people trying to doordash dunkin/baskin dual stores this also applies to most other meal delivery services.
baskin robbins has a core set of flavors that we must keep at all times, and a rotating monthly array of the other ones determined by both dunkin brands and the franchisee. this is also true for toppings, ltos and niche items such as mangonadas.
**doordash does not recognize that the flavors change and will show all of them as available!**
as such, when the order comes in, we must wait for the driver to come by, let them know the missing items and hope that the customer answers their phone. if they can't answer the phone, the driver cancels and another is sent over and over until either the customer picks up their phone, we decide to substitute something similar and write a note, or the customer cancels on their end.
at least at my location, we cannot cancel orders on our end for doordash. so please either call ahead to ask us what we have or be ready to answer the doordasher's call/text! it makes the situation much smoother and easier for all parties involved (plus you get your stuff faster!)

so far i have been baking and frosting roughly 600-700 donuts, plus croissants, bagels, muffins, munchkins. by the time i just get everything glazed and and frosted i am usually at roughly 11 hours, and they also expect me to put all the baked goods in their respective places and then wash all the trays and sweep and mop the store. which takes about another hour and a half or so. i just don't see how any of this is remotely possible. they also said as time goes by they expect production to go up once people get used to the new location being there. i have been doing 12-13 hour shifts to finish things and i am absolutely miserable.
is it like this everywhere? do other locations have multiple people baking? i know some locations get their donuts delivered so not every store bakes their own.

i managed to save about $4,000 this summer before going to school and hopefully finding a job there instead. dunkin taught me that it cannot be hard to run a business, something i want to do in the future. just be kind, polite and don't put up with any bullshit and you will be successful. i swear you can get anywhere and successful in life just by treating people the way you want to be treated. all in all, we all go through bs in our lives, working at dunkin or not, but its best to just keep moving forward and not give a fuck.",1660341126,final quit although work taught kind gener polit to peopl want coffe locat i work at bad i work year and there so mani incid drunk high cowork bullshit equip fail and fall apart and ridicul amount of hour that cut everyon i final enough one day i wa close from 2 00 to 7 30 30 hour a week and cowork work till 7 00 had the audac to onli hit my mom wa drop a car for me to drive back home give me a hard time and yell at me for stupid shit that i want to explain i had my two day off and final had enough and put a 5 day notic i wa just not happi work there anymor i know i would feel guilti i t put a notic but i realli want to give to the man and just walk like so mani peopl i manag to save 4 000 summer befor go to school and hope find a job there instead dunkin taught me that it cannot be hard to run a busi someth i want to in the futur just be kind polit and don t put bullshit and be success i swear you get anywher and success in life just treat peopl the way you want to be treat in all all go bs in live work at dunkin not but best to just keep move forward and not give a fuck

450,1,"the app is a hot mess as much as i love dunkin, the app is just frustratingly bad for something that was created by one of the world's most successful coffee chains.
all the time, i open the app to find that my saved gift card and credit card info have just completely vanished. i'll go to check out and it'll say ""add payment method"" as if i didn't have anything saved. i restart the app and then they magically re-appear.
half the time, the app randomly decides to not let me check out---the ""place order"" button turns grey and won't let me do anything. i've found that the only way around this issue is to delete the order and completely re-select everything.
and don't even get me started on the mess that is the points system. the ""deals"" they have often don't even work. my app currently has the ""mobile order an iced drink on monday and get 100 points"" deal going on right now. so i ordered an iced latte on the app this monday and the points never came through! this isn't the first time that this has happened!
i will say, however, the app sometimes messes up in a good way lmao. for instance, after i redeemed my free birthday drink in-store a couple months ago, the reward never left my app. so the next day, i used it in a mobile order and got a second free drink haha. and then just today, i was using another free drink reward i had. the drink was all that i ordered---so i paid nothing, but my app is trying to say that i spent like $15 in that transaction and gave me 60 free points for it.

510,1,"hectic day today at work was a nightmare. got in at 8am, clock in, and go to beverage 1 where i'm assigned. immediately i notice our ac is down. it's 95 degrees outside, we've only been open four hours but all of the donuts look melted and disgusting.
then i go to make a drink and notice is that the sticker machine is printing the writing huge, so only the first few letters of each ingredient are being shown on the sticker. ex. 1 cre, 2 fre, 4 su instead of 1 cream, 2 french vanilla, 4 sugars. and for frozens it would just say ""(size) frozen"" and we couldn't tell if it was a frozen coffee or frozen hot chocolate. so i had to keep looking on the screen to try and identify what i was making.
after figuring out what the first drink was i went to put cream in it, only for the dispenser not to shoot anything out (despite at least half full.) i try to use the other machine, same issue. i manually open tiny creamer packets, pour them in, and tell my manager so she knows it's broken.
next i fill a blender to make a frozen, and pass it off to beverage three for them to blend it. i hear them freaking out, look over, and the machine wouldn't stop dispensing ice. it was supposed to make a small coolata but it has completely filled the blender with ice and was still trying to dispense more. we had to shut down the machine and couldn't do frozens again for the rest of the day.
i got swapped to drivethrough later in the day, and noticed that our drivethrough window wasn't automatically shutting like it was supposed to. this would've been fine, seeing as there wasn't ac or anything so it's not like it could get any hotter, except it was rainy and the wind was blowing all the rain into the store. had to keep manually pushing/pulling on the window to get it to close and open.
not only was the rain getting in the store, but it was raining so hard that i was practically screaming into my headset and the people in the drivethrough couldn't hear me still! and then they'd get upset that i wasn't taking their order even though i was trying to, and i had to explain at the window that it was just because of the rain.
then my manager made me take the trash + all the boxes out. in the rain. on truck day, where i had 5 trash cans worth of boxes + 2 trash cans of actual trash.

592,1,"should i complain? my mother can be a bit much sometimes, honestly i don't even know why she bothered to order just a black coffee, but we don't have a coffee maker right now so i can't shame her on that too much. she likes to claim allergies because she read the ""how to karen"" handbook that says apparently claiming allergies will get it absolutely removed, but even still.... i guess i should start at the beginning.
we went to dunkin today because i wanted a coffee since i've been up since 5am due to a new medication schedule that ain't working for me. we go in because the line in the drive through was a bit long. i ordered my usual(butter pecan with oat milk iced latte), my stepfathers cappuccino blast because ours is the fancy baskin robins conjoined twin, and my mother wants a ""black coffee ice blended thingy"" me trying to translate ""just a blended black coffee"", she asks for no dairy or sugar of any kind because she is on a ""diet""(and thinks she's better than us for it), now i don't care about her ordering it without dairy or sugar or anything because if she wants to drink her bitter burnt coffee beans i'm not going to stop her.
i redeem my free beverage for my drink because why not. we are waiting for our drinks, mine and my stepfathers are finished first, and now we're waiting on my mothers. the girl comes over and asks if my mother wants whipped cream, i understand why, some people ask for no dairy or dairy alternatives but still get whipped cream but my mother gets the karen hair up her ass and freaks out ""i said no cream! i only wanted a frozen blended black coffee!"" despite the fact she knows that i get panic attacks over any person getting outrageously upset, i manage to hold together despite wanting to gag my mother with the dish towel.
well, for some reason the girl becomes very upset over this and cops an attitude. like i can understand my mothers attitude not being the best, not by a very far margin, but the girl began acting like my mother had held her down and called her names.
""well you ordered a cappuccino blast."" the girl first goes ""that's my husbands yes, i am allergic to dairy!!"" (honestly not sure if she's allergic or lactose intolerant like me, she claims she had some joint pain and felt swollen and bloated the last time she had some dairy). i explain my mother just wanted a black coffee blended up with ice, while my mother is freaking out and going ""i just wanted a black coffee with ice!""(leaving off the blended part entirely which probably is what spurs this next part), while one girl is going ""i'm going to fix this for you ma'am."" the girl comes over and slams down a cup of just black ice coffee in front of my mother and walks off. while another girl is explaining that if my mother wanted it blended, it had to be done with dairy or cream in it which honestly doesn't even sound right to me, but i don't work there so whatever. as we are leaving the girl calls ""have a good day ma'am!"" after my mother as i am trying to herd her out the door.

694,1,"sexual harassment at the dunks i work at.. hey, y'all..
this is my first time posting on this subreddit.
anyway, i started working at my very close dunkins for the past month and a few weeks, and it has been alright. i do overnights and it's just drive-thru only until the front doors are unlocked. the plus side is the pay rate and my awesome co-worker. but once 4 am rolls around, these three guys punch in and are there for the early morning shift. one is a baker, the other is always at sandwich station as the other is there to just open the front doors for eat in and does the necessary morning shift stuff like temperature records, etc.
so, i've noticed it is just me (a female) working overnight with my co-worker who's a dude. majority of this dunks are all men besides my manager and two-morning shift workers. we are always together doing the work and i refuse to leave my ""space"" on the drive-thru area because these early morning shift guys (the 4 am crew) give me an uncomfortable vibe and i hate the way each of them stares at me when i'm just trying to do my job and i have caught each of them staring at me in a weird way especially when i'm bending over to reach something from the ground level. almost three weeks ago, the guy who is responsible for being on the front counter and opening up, said to me ""maybe i can help you get better sleep"" with a wink after i complained that i will be tired when i get home and even if i try to sleep, i have two kids under the age of 6 who need my care. when he said that, i felt disgusted and gave him a glare and told him that wasn't cool which he laughed off. then a week ago and this week, he purposely tried bumping into me so he can feel my ass while i'm making coffee orders in the drive-thru (he's a big average guy but c'mon, there's still space between us but he makes it seem like its cramped). my co-worker has been observant of this behavior ad has told both my manager and me about it and he hates it because all i'm trying to do is my job and i'm already in a committed relationship with kids. my manager has reported these guys and they each have a history of making other (ex) female employees uncomfortable that they either transferred out of the store or quit. my manager has also spoken to this guy but he's back at it with his lewd comments and giving me that off creep vibes. yesterday after leaving, my co-worker stayed behind to count his register and he heard these guys (including the cleaner and other male crew members) talking about how ""f\*\*\*able"" i look, how my ass looks, etc) and my co-worker snapped at them by \*again\* telling them that i'm 27 and happily taken, and to stop talking about me like that.
they all laughed at him and kept on with their conversation.
i'm disgusted, repulsed, and don't feel comfortable showing up to work in this kind of environment and i'm sure anyone else will agree. i have vented to my husband about these issues and it has made him very pissed off that before i was ready to clock out this past sunday, he came to pick me up but went straight to the front counter to ask for my manager and she was there and can see how pissed he was and is aware of the situation that she asked him to follow her to her office and talk to him about this and showed him her reports she has made against these guys. all my manager can say is that if i want, i can call hr/corporate directly and just make a complaint or threaten them with a harassment lawsuit because she has made numerous complaints and all these guys get is a ""slap on the wrist"" and my manager's boss has already made it clear that they don't want to fire anyone because the dunks i work at is very short-staffed already..
idk guys, please share your opinions about this or message me privately. i'm to the point of just quitting or relocating but this store is the closest to my apartment and if i chose to be transferred, i know i'm gonna need to travel and don't have a car at this moment.",1658525249,sexual harass dunk work at hey first time post thi subreddit anyway i start work at my close dunkin the past month week and alright i overnight and it drive thru the front door unlock the plu side is the pay rate and my awesom co worker 4 roll around three guy punch and are for the earli morn shift one is a baker the is alway at sandwich station the other is there just open the front door for eat in and the necessari morn shift stuff like temperatur record etc i notic it is just a femal work overnight my co worker s a dude major thi dunk are all men besid my manag and two morn shift worker are alway togeth the work and i refus to leav my space on the drive thru area these earli morn shift guy the 4 am crew give me uncomfort vibe and i hate the way of stare at me i just tri to do my job and i caught each of them stare at me in a weird way especi when i m bend to reach someth the ground level almost three week ago the guy who is respons for on the front counter and open said to me mayb i help get better sleep with a wink i complain i tire when i get home and even i tri to sleep i have two kid the age of 6 who need my care when said that i felt disgust and gave a glare and told him that cool he laugh a week ago and thi week he purpos tri bump me so he can feel my ass i m make coffe order in the drive thru he s a big averag guy but c mon there s still space us but he make it seem like cramp my co worker ha been observ of thi behavior ad ha told my manag and me it and he hate it becaus all i m tri to do is my job and i m alreadi in a commit relationship with kid my manag ha report these guy and each have a histori of make other ex femal employe uncomfort that they either transfer of the store quit my manag ha also spoken to thi guy but he s back at it with lewd comment and give me that off creep vibe yesterday after leav my co worker stay behind to count hi regist and he heard these guy includ the cleaner and other male crew member talk about f abl i look how my ass look etc and my co worker snap at them tell them that i m 27 and happili taken and to stop talk about me like that they all laugh at him and kept on with convers i m disgust repuls and t feel comfort show up to work in thi kind of environ and i m sure anyon els will agre i have vent to my husband about these issu and it ha made him veri piss off that i readi to clock out thi past sunday he came to pick me up but went straight to the front counter to ask for my manag and wa there and can see how piss he wa and is awar of the situat that she ask him to follow to her offic and talk to him about thi and show him her report she ha made these guy all my manag can say is that if i want i can call hr corpor directli and just make a complaint or threaten them with a harass lawsuit becaus she ha made numer complaint and all these guy get is a slap on the wrist and my manag s boss ha alreadi made it clear that they don t want to fire anyon becaus the dunk i work at is veri short staf alreadi idk guy pleas share opinion about thi or messag me privat i m to the point of just quit or reloc but thi store is the closest to my apart and if i chose to be transfer i know i m gonna need to travel and don t have a car at thi moment

apparently she's a regular, but because of my schedule i've never seen her before. however, my availability changed so ive been working earlier hours, meaning i've started to encounter her.
my first time meeting her was today when i was working drive through. it wasn't super busy and she walked up (yes, walked) to our drivethrough speaker asking for a free water. i said okay, because it's just water and it was a super hot day, and called out to my coworker asking for a medium water.

i tried to ask in the drive through to cook both sides, and the girl said ""okay, so you want it 'extra toasty'"". i thought that was dunkin lingo, so i started ordering them that way, ""i'll have a grilled cheese sandwich, extra toasty"" (i felt foolish saying it every time). the results were hit or miss; so, i figured ""extra toasty"" isn't actually a dunkin term... the girl just said that.
so, i went back requesting them to ""toast the sandwich on both sides, please"". it's still a roll of the dice. sometimes it's perfect, sometimes it's double-toasted on the same damn side and not toasted on the other side, and once they just assembled it and gave it to me untoasted. but, usually it's the same way... toasted on one side.

813,1,"been working here 3 weeks now : i believe 85% of customers are idiots let me start a list of some of the most weird shit / dumbest shit customers say:
\- they order 'well done hash browns' as if it's a steak or something. i actually laughed when someone ordered and asked them what they meant, dude says, just put the hash browns in the oven for 2 rotations. i highly doubt that's what he really wanted.
\- ""let me get a small black iced coffee with 2 shots of x, 2 sugar, and some caramel""
\- i had a guy order a black hot coffee with 3 creams, no sugar. gave it to him, he complained it had 3 creams. same guy proceeds to order again, 2 frozen medium coffees. give him the first one, buddy loses it and screams that he wanted a small. i told him ok i'll give him a small even though he paid for mediums.
\- i had someone order 3 sandwhiches, then goes to wait, next person ordered a small coffee and a glaze stick. i give him it. first customer comes over and starts getting in my face about someone else getting served first. i said he didn't order hot food, the customer goes ""well he has the same bag"", i was actually dumbfounded at how stupid you gotta be to say that and think that that is how things work.
\- people really think as i'm making someone's coffee they can order by yelling at me their order. i usually just ignore these tards.
\- people that wait in line and come up to you and go ""i ordered on the app"", like okay.
\- people that come in complain we don't have their mobile order and then i look at their app and tell them they ordered to a different dunkins. very satisfying especially when they're all worked up over 'our' error.
\- had a guy scream at me for a blueberry donut, i said i'm too new here to understand where they might be and he points to the cornbread donuts and asks for that one. not sure if he was happy with the result.
\- had another guy scream at me after i asked him to confirm he wanted 2 coconut donuts.
\- had a crazy ass lady that spent her whole day sitting in the dunks ask for the dragonfruit refresher in a cup and ask if it would be free. like, what.
\- have multiple idiots that think the tip jar is a 'take a penny' type deal. it's not.
\- people who don't move out of the way after they order when there is a line.
\- had a dude scream at me ""when am i gonna get my coffee i been waitin here for 5 minutes"" during a rush. we are 2 people working, ive been there at that point a week probably.
\- had another dude get his croissant wrong it was chocolate not plain and he lost his mind and walked out yelling fuck this instead of waiting for a plain one to be heated, literally does not take even a minute.
\- people that are rude / yell at you then come back in and pretend it never happened, naw ur service is gonna be slow as hell and i'm going to be rude back to you.
\- some of these peoples coffee orders are legitimately disgusting and sometimes half the cup is full of flavoring shit, like u see the posts on here all the time about nasty coffee orders, it's true and a good chunk of the time it's ordered on ubereats/grubhub/doordash.

831,1,"tips for customers here are some things i've noticed that bug workers and customers alike
1) if you are ordering a dozen donuts and you want to pick them out dear god do not do it through the drive thru. come in. also donuts typically sell out by 1pm so if you come at 5 and ask for a dozen you will probably be let down.
2) if you want cream or sugar please say that. if you want a specific amount, tell the person. so many times people assume the employees just know their order and know how they take their coffee and then get mad when it doesn't come out the way they wanted. also- we don't mind re making drinks at all.
3) if you say you want a medium black coffee with caramel in it- then it's no longer a black coffee because the swirls have milk built in.
4) if you place your mobile order a minute before you come it won't be ready. and if you place it and come thru an hour later everything will be melted. my best advice is to place it before leaving your house so it will be ready when you come.
5) if you have two separate orders please tell the person at the window instead of just starting at them and not leaving the drive thru. sometimes it's so busy the order taker doesn't have time to notify the cashier that someone has two separate orders and people will just sit in their cars looking into space for 5 minutes instead of telling you they had a second order.
6) if you pay in all change i will personally take 10 minutes to count it and hand your food out, i get if it was a $2 bill but if you give me $8 worth of dimes and nickels and are rude about it (most times) then i will take my sweet old time doing it.
7) most important- we are just people like you we are just doing our jobs and it's just coffee. if it is wrong, ask nicely and it will be remade. so many people treat food workers as personal servants and get mad when they aren't catered to during a rush where everyone is doing 5 things at once. be patient and nice and appreciate that it's just coffee and mess ups can be fixed :) i can tell you that the regular customers we are rude are very well known and all the employees know who is rude and who isn't before they even come up to the window. and the regular customers who are sweet bulls relationships and we are happy to see them!",1657542336,tip custom thing notic bug worker custom alik 1 are order dozen and you want pick dear god do drive thru come also donut typic sell out 1pm if you come 5 and ask for a dozen you probabl let 2 if you want cream sugar pleas say that if you want a specif amount tell the person so mani time peopl assum the employe know order and know take their coffe and get mad it come out the way they want also t mind make drink at 3 if you say you want a medium black coffe caramel in it then it longer a black coffe the swirl milk built in 4 if you place mobil order a minut you come it t be readi and if you place it and come thru hour later everyth will be melt best advic to place it befor leav your hous so it will be readi when you come 5 if you have two separ order pleas tell the person at the window instead just start at them and not leav the drive thru sometim it s so busi the order taker doesn t have time to notifi the cashier that someon two separ order and peopl will just sit in their car look space for 5 minut instead of tell you they a second order 6 if you pay in all chang i will person take 10 minut to count it and hand your food out i get if it a 2 bill if you give 8 worth of dime and nickel and are rude it time then i will take my sweet old time it 7 most import we are just peopl like you we are just do job and it s just coffe if it is wrong ask nice and it will be remad so mani peopl treat food worker person servant and get mad when they t cater to a rush everyon is do 5 thing at be patient and nice and appreci that it s just coffe and mess up be fix i can tell you that the regular custom we are rude are well known and all the employe know is rude and who t befor they even come to the window and the regular custom who are sweet bull relationship and we are happi to see them

i went to dunks last week and had the worst experience. i have never complained but i wish i had in this case.
pulled into the drive thru, dunks was empty. sat at the mic for 12 minutes until someone finally spoke up. teens were laughing and goofing off, but i really just needed a coffee so i stayed. ordered a small black iced coffee with sugar and avocado toast.
pulled to the window and couldn't see anyone in there. sat around for 10 minutes before i almost left and finally a woman came by. she looked cooked out of her mind and asked me again what i had ordered. i repeated my order twice to her and she repeated it back to me and charged me. she then handed me a medium hot coffee with xx, and i swear someone had already drank from it because there was pink lipgloss on the cap...
annoyed i just explained my order again and she apologized.
i see her goofing off with some guy through the window, and i waited for another 10 minutes. i got so annoyed i knocked on the window. pissed this time i just kindly asked for my coffee and food. she then handed me a wet bag and a small iced coffee with some type of swirl in it. i wound up leaving rather then complaining.
got home and the avocado toast wasn't out in the regular box, it was wrapped in a napkin, soggy wet, with brown avocado spread...
i wish i had the courage to complain, but honestly the employees gave me such an off putting vibe i didn't want to put up with them. i'm debating writing in anonymously to the manager because now that i have shared my experiences my siblings and friends also had bad experiences with those two as well. my dad even pointed out that the guy doesn't even work there, or just is never in uniform. and the woman often had her kids back there with her.

2) cold brew with brown sugar cold foam: this drink is only cold brew with foam on top and no syrup by default.
if you go in app --> order --> crafted cold brew, you'll see both these options.
now what is happening is either you're ordering number 2 above expecting number 1 or the person taking order is confusing between the two. but both options exist on the menu.

some info- i live in a small town in new england. dunkins quite popular. husband works at various job sites and frequents a dunkin location 2-3 times a week, goes to other locations the other days.
i place his mobile orders for him through the app every time he needs it which is often.
i am placing these orders 10-15 minutes before he arrives at the locations. why? because the food part of the order is only ready half of the time. so we figure give them lots of extra time to have it done. but it happened again this morning. i placed the order at 6:45am, husband walked in at 7am. drink is ready, food isnt.
weve never been offered refunds, never even really complained to the workers because we arent the confrontational kind. at this point im just irritated for my husband. he doesnt have time to get in line and wait after finding out his food isnt ready for 10 mins. hence why we use mobile ordering in the first place. so he can walk in, get his stuff, walk out. for months they just...never gave him the donuts he ordered. now its whatever food he gets. the drinks the only thing present.
i wish i had a record of how often this happens. it sounds ridiculous but we've been doing this for over a year, and i want to say at least 30-40% of the time he walks out without breakfast and is upset, to say the least.

1177,1,"i'm wondering if my co-workers were talking shit because of something small i did at work. okay, so this has been bugging me for the past few hours ever since i ended my shift today at work. so, i work at the local dunkin's in my town and the day was mostly good. one of my better workdays even. i'm new and have only been there for a month and a half by now. today, during one of the last hours of my shift, i was trying to fix the donut case. it was almost noon and there were two empty spaces at the top that i wanted to fill with two single trays of donuts that were at the bottom so i could cover the last shelf with the blinds once it was empty.
this girl who i just met last week starts coming over while i am thinking about putting them next to the big trays of donuts and is like ""you probably can just leave the space empty because i'm going to move the muffins over there."" now the muffins are perfectly placed at the top and usually sitting there in the other case because they're supposed to be. not to mention there is a full single tray of each muffin next to each other. the second case was looking nice. there were cases with single donuts, and i would gladly move them to a different tray that has space, but sometimes the manager tells me to leave them in their own tray, so we don't confuse the customers. plus there were plenty of donuts in other trays, and spaces between the trays at the top that needed to be filled and they would perfectly be there, if i just placed some in the middle at the top and fill any empty spaces with some donut trays at the bottom, like my supervisor usually tells me to do.
i don't know if this girl is returning employee or new, she might have been the former, but i was a little confused when she told me that she was going to transfer the muffins there. i mean, i've seen other co-workers just do what i was initially going to do. when i told her what i was about to do, she was like ""i'm just telling you this because i'm closing and am going to put the muffins over on this case instead"". i told her i was just putting some on there for now so there wouldn't be empty gaps because i know our boss doesn't like that, and i placed a tray of boston kreme at the top to fill a gap. she just said ""okay, you can do that for now,"" but then i saw her walk over to two of our other co-workers who were just standing there by drive-thru looking at us, and she looks like she was saying something to them, and then the other co-worker she was talking to said ""yeah, that's how everyone else feels,"" while she was looking right at me. and i was like ""are they talking about me?""
like, what does ""everyone \[supposedly\] feel""? because i wasn't trying to be a jerk or know-it-all. i know i'm new i was just trying to follow what i was usually told, especially since i had tried to put different pastries on certain trays and told to ""keep some in their own trays instead and focus on filling the gaps"". plus, i still had chores to finish before my shift ends and fixing the donut case is one of them, so i didn't want to just stand there and do nothing. i immediately asked the other two co-workers if i had made a mistake and explained what i was trying to do. they told me that they might move stuff over soon, so i was like ""okay"".
i then told the girl that i'm just ""leaving some trays up there to fill in the gaps for now"" because i didn't want to leave the case looking incomplete like that. then she was like ""okay, it's just that i have a certain way of doing things when organizing the cases."" and i was like ""okay, i understand."" i was like, 'alright, i'll leave it to her. she probably is just a returning employee and have done this many times already. it's whatever. my only issue is that fact that it seems like she was talking about me or what i was doing to the other co-workers and one of them was making a passive-aggressive comment while looking in my direction. i didn't know exactly what the girl whispered to her, but with what she did immediately after what i said i was trying to do, it seems like this is what happened.
you could easily guess what the subject of their mini-chat was about at that point. and i'm thinking ""okay. i'm not trying to step on anyone's toes. i'm just trying to do my job. if this girl has something to say, she can say it to my face instead of being a fake b\*tch and trying to say something behind my back as if i wouldn't notice. as for the other co-worker, she's said some mild condescending shit before (did on my second day of work, if you remember my post about that), but she's usually upfront with me on some stuff if i've made a mistake. i don't need that passive-aggressive nonsense just because i wanted to just fill the remaining gaps on a donut case. you know? like, i don't have time for that toxic bs. it's rude and petty. like, if i was making a mistake here by not letting her do it before my shift ends or something, my bad, but it does not warrant that behavior. not to mention the fact that they seemed a bit standoffish when i was clocking out for work annoyed me, too. like, it's not that deep. have any of you ever dealt with something like this months within your start at dunkin' donuts?",1654897794,wonder co worker talk shit someth small i work okay bug past hour ever sinc i end my shift today at work so i work at the local my town the day mostli good one of my better workday even i m new and been for month and a half today one of the last hour of my shift i wa tri fix the case wa almost noon and there were two empti space at the top i want to fill two singl tray of that were at the bottom so i could cover the last shelf with the blind it wa empti thi girl i met last week start come i think put next to the big tray of donut and like probabl just leav the space empti becaus i m go to move the muffin over there now the muffin perfectli place at the top and usual sit there in the case becaus suppos to to mention there is a full singl tray of muffin next to each other the second case wa look nice there were case with singl donut and i would gladli move them to a differ tray that ha space sometim the manag tell me to leav them in tray so confus the custom plu there were plenti of donut in other tray and space the tray at the top that need to be fill and they would perfectli be there if i just place in the middl at the top and fill empti space with some donut tray at the bottom like my supervisor usual tell me to i don t know if thi girl is return employe new might have been the former but i wa a littl confus she told me that she wa go to transfer the muffin there i mean i seen other co worker just do i wa initi go to do when i told what i wa about to do she wa like i m just tell you thi becaus i m close and am go to put the muffin over thi case instead i told her i wa just put some on there for now so there t be empti gap becaus i know boss t like that and i place a tray of boston kreme at the top to fill a gap she just said okay you can do that for now but i saw her walk over to two of our other co worker who were just stand there by drive thru look at us and she look like she wa say someth to them and then the other co worker she wa talk to said yeah that s everyon els feel while she wa look right at me and i wa like are they talk about me like what everyon supposedli feel becaus i t tri to be a jerk or know it i know i m new i wa just tri to follow what i wa usual told especi sinc i tri to put differ pastri on certain tray and told to keep some in their own tray instead and focu on fill the gap plu i still had chore to finish my shift end and fix the donut case is one of them so i t want to just stand there and do noth i immedi ask the other two co worker if i had made a mistak and explain what i wa tri to do they told me that they might move stuff over soon so i wa like okay i then told the girl that i m just leav some tray there to fill in the gap for now becaus i didn t want to leav the case look incomplet like that then she wa like okay it s just that i have a certain way of thing when organ the case and i wa like okay i understand i wa like alright i leav it to her she probabl is just a return employe and have done thi mani time alreadi it s whatev my onli issu is that fact that it seem like she wa talk about me or what i wa do to the other co worker and one of them wa make a passiv aggress comment while look in my direct i didn t know exactli what the girl whisper to her but with what she did immedi what i said i wa tri to do it seem like thi is what happen you could easili guess what the subject of their mini chat wa about at that point and i m think okay i m not tri to step on anyon s toe i m just tri to do my job if thi girl ha someth to say she can say it to my face instead of a fake b tch and tri to say someth behind my back if i wouldn t notic as for the other co worker she s said some mild condescend shit befor did on my second day of work if you rememb my post about that but she s usual upfront with me on some stuff if i ve made a mistak i don t need that passiv aggress nonsens just becaus i want to just fill the remain gap on a donut case you know like i don t have time for that toxic bs it s rude and petti like if i wa make a mistak by not let her do it befor my shift end or someth my bad but it doe not warrant that behavior not to mention the fact that they seem a bit standoffish when i wa clock for work annoy me like it s not that deep have ani of you ever dealt with someth like thi month within start at dunkin donut

i got to work at around 3:25pm after having a panic attack over missing part of my uniform and overall having a bad day and being late. i clock in, put my stuff away and go to the front.
there's a lady standing at the donut racks looking irritated, she looked at me and and said ""we'll are you going to help me?"" and i politely said ""sure if you come over to the cash register i can get your order started""
she comes over and starts her order, 18 munchkins and 2 custard filled donuts. after confirming with my co worker, i tell her we don't have any more. she immediately cops an attitude, saying how ridiculous it is we don't have donuts. i just kind of sit there until she decided on a new donut, she wanted bismarck, again, we're out of that. at that point she throws her hands down and says ""fine i don't want any of it. i want a refund."" so i put the munchkins and donuts away.
i've never done a refund before, ever, so i try to ask one of the older girls, who tells me to text the manager. i text the manger who, is no help. so i figure it out myself after sitting there for 20 mins trying to figure it out, about half way through she asked to speak to a manager and my manager wasn't there and she responded with ""so they're having people who are useless and worthless at their job working with out a manager? wow"" at this point im trying not to cry, im shaking violently, i haven't eaten or drank at all at this point, im tired and not having a good day.
i sit there and i don't say anything and i figure it out and accidentally refunded for 14 munchkins and the two donuts instead of 18 munchkins so literally $1.05 was missing. she, once again, called me useless at my job and she wanted the managers number who was ignoring me now. she was yelling at me and i genuinely thought it was the system because i double checked and thought everything was okay, luckily at this point my managers boss came in and helped her, the lady switched her attitude with her and wasn't rude at all while i was sitting there trying not to break down sobbing in the middle of the lobby.
once my managers boss left i immediately went to the freezer and sobbed for a good 5 minutes. luckily i had awesome customers the rest of the day :)

i hate seeing articles like this because it really just shows that people don't understand how menus work. you can get any flavor in a coffee. a caramel cold brew is not a different menu item from a normal cold brew. that's why they separate the flavors from the drinks on the menu.
what makes it even worse is stuff like the final entry ""caramel cold foam cold brew,"" where they say they don't know if it's the same caramel that goes in the foam as that which goes in the drink. like, no, the foam comes from a can and the caramel swirl is a syrup.

i ordered a ""medium iced cake batter latte with whole milk""
they gave me a medium iced *coffee* (cake batter) with oat milk. okay no problem, people make mistakes. another barista remade it.
except this time she put a large iced cake batter signature latte on the counter. i asked whose it was. i thought maybe someone else ordered a cake batter signature latte *because i sure as hell didn't*. the barista said, ""this is what you ordered"". i said no i didn't.
she upgraded me to a large signature because of their earlier mistake, which is my guess. which is fine. but i don't want a 700-million calorie bomb with the whipped cream nasty mocha drizzle sprinkle bullshit on top. ugh. i just wanted a basic bitch iced latte with 3 cake batter swirls. why is that so hard?
anyway, i didn't ask them to remake it, said thank you and walked away. i think if you're going to upgrade someone's drink, ask them first: ""would you like me to upgrade your drink to a large signature as a courtesy?""
taste test: initial sip i get a massive sugar alcohol taste. it reminds me of old-school starbucks french vanilla frappuccino's. i honestly don't taste cake batter. just tastes like heavy french vanilla+alcohol. it's not the worst swirl i've tried. but i can't say that i am a fan. i definitely prefer the butter pecan now that i've tried both. with butter pecan i can still taste the espresso. whereas with this one i don't taste coffee at all. it just tastes like sugar alcohol. so yeah, looks like this is a dud for me and i probably won't buy it again. #bringbacksaltedcaramel",1651419516,review cake batter signatur latt oh boy absolut shit show went the closest to my gym workout thi locat alway hit miss i known better i order a medium ice cake batter latt whole milk gave a medium ice coffe cake batter with oat milk okay problem peopl make mistak anoth barista remad except thi time put a larg ice cake batter signatur latt the counter i ask whose it wa i thought mayb someon els order a cake batter signatur latt i sure hell the barista said thi is what order i said no i didn t she upgrad me to a larg signatur becaus of earlier mistak is my guess which is fine i t want a 700 million calori bomb with the whip cream nasti mocha drizzl sprinkl bullshit on top ugh i want a basic bitch ice latt with 3 cake batter swirl is so hard anyway i didn t ask to remak it said thank you and walk away i think you go to upgrad someon drink ask them first would you like me to upgrad drink to a larg signatur as a courtesi tast test initi sip i get a massiv sugar alcohol tast it remind me of old school french vanilla frappuccino s i honestli don t tast cake batter just tast like heavi french vanilla alcohol it s the worst swirl i tri but i t say that i a fan i definit prefer the butter pecan that i ve tri with butter pecan i can still tast the espresso wherea with thi one i don t tast coffe it just tast like sugar alcohol so yeah look like thi is a dud me and i probabl t buy it bringbacksaltedcaramel

1689,1,"life hacks to get more milk/alt-milk in your drink this is based off how my stores machines operate.
for 2% milk and skim, request specifically 3-5 milk. specify a number. if you don't, it'll just say ""milk"" and most employees will use the lowest setting unless a number is specified. these milks (and cream) get dispensed from a machine.
for dairy, almond, or coconut - at my store we literally eye these unless it's a latte or macchiato. i would ask for the cup 1/4, 1/3, or 1/2 filled with milk. pls don't take too much advantage of this and try to shortcut a latte. lattes are made with espresso so it will not be the same no matter how much milk you put in.
if you're dining in, ask the front counter person to communicate that w/the staff cuz i don't think the pos has a way to note that. and if you just say ""3 almond/oat/coconut"" some stores are eyeballing it and are more bound to mess it up.
and of course please be kind and patient! we are overworked and usually understaffed. having a better idea of what exactly you're looking for helps us not have to remake it, and helps you get more than a splash of milk lol",1651110563,life hack get milk alt milk drink base store machin oper 2 milk skim request specif 3 5 milk specifi number say milk and employe use lowest set unless a number is specifi milk and cream get dispens a machin for dairi almond coconut my store liter eye these unless it a latt or macchiato would ask for the cup 1 4 1 3 or 1 2 fill milk pl don t take much advantag thi and tri to shortcut a latt latt made with espresso it will the matter how much milk you put in if you dine in ask the front counter person to commun w the staff cuz i don t think the po a way to note that and if you just say 3 almond oat coconut store are eyebal it and are more bound to mess it and of cours pleas be kind and patient we are overwork and usual understaf a better idea of exactli you re look for help us not to remak it and help you get more a splash of milk lol

just threw me right in! it was bad. when i switched to night shift, the woman working with me bullied me into quitting because she preferred working alone to keep the whole 10 dollars in tips she made.

i then went and trained at another location to watch du videos with a very nice hr lady. everything seems to be going well but i'm worried about moving too slow or making too many mistakes or getting yelled at by massholes. normal people can handle this but cue ptsd and high functioning autism.

#x200b;
cake batter swirl (in a small iced coffee, cream only): okay, this is the one i was looking forward to the most. i love cake batter flavored things, and this was pretty great. for some reason, when pumping it it comes out thin so ask for a little extra. it's sweet, but when trying to mix swirls together it gets muddied up by the other flavors. 8/10
butter pecan (in a small iced coffee, cream only): when i got hired last september, we still had some and god, there is definitely a reason why everyone loves it. it's sweet, nutty, everything great. i don't care if the ice cream market looks at it as a geezer flavor, it's a 10/10!
mango pineapple refresher (sample cup of pure concentrate): okay not gonna lie, it's underwhelming. it just tastes pineappley with not much other substance to it. my mistake for doing that. 4/10
mango pineapple refresher (green tea): the green tea brings something out of it at least, giving it some depth besides fruitiness. 6/10.
mango pineapple refresher (coconutmilk): i'm sorry, but if i'm going to try this, i need an ambulance crew on standby. a little coconut is fine, but having a drink being half-coconut milk would probably kill me
#x200b;
now we're in the weird stuff
strawberry shortcake 2.0: ask for a vanilla bean coolata with 2 pumps strawbery and a non-cautious amount of cake batter. if you thought the vanilla bean + strawberry on it's own was great, try that.
""illegal"" lemonade refreshers: if your dunkin has bottled lemonade, ask for any of the refreshers with just concentrate and room in the cup. put the lemonade in. this has been my go to drink for the past few weeks.

i'm getting to that point where i want to quit for real this time. i'm the main baker, and during the golden age of my employment as i call it (last spring/early summer) i really loved my job. i made a lot of friends and work didn't feel like work.
but in the fall of last year, things got pretty blah and now things are just getting bad. we got bought out by a big company and they're making so many changes, like the dress code. we're even changing how the donut case is organized and specific kinds of donuts go into assorted dozens now, which led to us running out of blueberry at like 7am. and i love the way i organized my donuts and i don't want to be told what to do in the one thing where i felt like i had creative freedom... corporate obviously doesn't listen to what we feel is best and what works for our individual store.
worst part, there's literally so much drama lately! i almost walked out today because my coworkers are like going at each other's throats. i'm going to feel bad if i end up leaving because i know how hard it is to find a baker. but this place has been sucking the life out of me for the past year and a half overall and i can't anymore. this isn't even to mention how the customers in the town that i work can be so mean and racist as well. we've had sandwiches thrown at us, direct threats, and some people have used terrible derogatory terms that i won't repeat here. all have been banned by our store, but similar people eventually take their place. the kind people get fewer and far between no matter how nice i am to them. all of it makes me dread coming in to work.
i miss our old manager, but our newer manager is awesome and i know he's trying his best and he's doing well. i don't want to let him down. but i just can't do the drama anymore or the early mornings or people yelling at me. it's getting real bad for my mental health. i would be sad to leave but maybe it really is time.

2018,1,"my time there and why i quit i only workers there for two and a half weeks. at first everything was fine. yes i'd get yelled at for being to slow even in my first day when i was learning despite the fact my average time came in around 2 minutes. i would get 30hrs a week and it stayed like that my second week. i enjoyed it at the time and my coworkers are great people. but once my third week came i only got 16hrs. i worked the first shift but it was only 4hrs. when i came in for my second one this morning i looked around and ended up walking out.
that may seem sudden but on top of getting yelled at no matter how fast i got (average prep time for my kitchen job was 1 minute) getting told i'll only be getting up to 12 hrs a week from next week onwards and having to wake up at 04:30 every morning i worked well i just couldn't justify it.
i was only making $12.50 per hour so gas alone would cost more to come to and from then i would make. throw in my monthly bills so i wouldn't be able to afford it. thus leading to me resigning this morning because sadly it was the more financially viable option.
if it wasn't for the low hours i'd still be working there and would of been working when i'm typing this but with my low pay and the fact id be spending more money in gas then i'd make in a pay period on top of the low hours and pay less to me leaving. i also have bills to pay so spending more on gas then i'd make made the hours with such low pay even more unjustifiable.

for one of them, it seems to vary across their stores. almond milk used to be $0.50 across the board. but now only some of their stores have it at $0.50.
for their other stores, almond milk is $0.59 if it's added to a drink, like a hot/iced coffee or cold brew with almond milk in it. and if a drink is made with almond milk, like a latte or cappuccino made with almond milk, they now charge $1.09 for it.
i think it's ridiculous that almond milk is costing this much now. why won't they keep it as $0.50? lots of people have dairy allergies or intolerances. i haven't checked the other nondairy milks, but i imagine they did the same price raises face_with_rolling_eyes",1647182937,anyon els local s rais price almond milk area two differ franchise run dunkin s for one seem vari across store almond milk use to 0 50 across the board of their store it 0 50 for their store almond milk is 0 59 it s ad to drink like a hot ice coffe cold brew almond milk in it if a drink is made with almond milk like a latt or cappuccino made with almond milk now charg 1 09 for it think it s ridicul almond milk is cost much now they keep it 0 50 lot of peopl have dairi allergi or intoler i t check the other nondairi milk but i imagin they the price rais face_with_rolling_ey

full disclosure, i've never been to dunkin donuts before today. before i met my wife, i'd spent the majority of my life in a small town where your best bet for coffee drinks was mcdonald's (even that was only after they introduced the mccafe line-up). i'd heard of dd and seen some commercials, but never actually been to one myself.
my wife and i currently live in a more populated area with tons of options for coffee (not joking, i didn't know what a macchiato was until i was 32), and today on my way home from work she asked me to stop in the dunkins drive-through. one iced coffee with 10 creams 4 sugars, and a side of mini hashbrowns.
here's where it gets prickly, at the end, she mentioned she wanted an order of ""dumpy dunks"". when i asked her what those were she said they were similar to donut holes. when i pulled up to the drive-through window to place the order, everything went smooth until i couldn't find ""dumpy dunks"" anywhere on the menu. i asked the person taking my order if they had been discontinued and after a while of pausing he said he didn't remember that product ever being sold in store (he also mentioned that he was new). for the next 5 minutes, i waited as he asked different employees in the store if they had ever sold ""dumpy dunks"", all of which said no.

2545,0,"sbux failed me...(trenta sized rant) 266**** signing off. this month i quit my job at arguably the most successful coffee chain company, which i once embraced and fully loved. i worked there for just over 3.5 years. while there are multiple reasons that i decided to leave, i wanted to share my experience with reporting sexual harassment.
in february of 2021, two years into my employment at this company. a shift supervisor transferred to the store where i had worked since it opened. he ended up sexually harassing not only me but multiple female employees, including minors.
for a few months, i was in denial about the misconduct. however, many of my co-workers pointed out the ""special interest"" the shift supervisor had taken with me. once it was shared with me that he had said borderline predatory comments to minors at my store, i decided enough was enough.
initially, i was hesitant to speak out about the harassment because i knew the district manager, dave schuberth, favored him. they had weekly meetings about potentially making him an asm.
i drafted a document outlining the harassment. i had close to fifteen of my fellow baristas who either experienced harassment or witnessed it sign their names. i presented it to my store manager, who then escalated it to dave.
bare minimum, i asked that this shift supervisor be transferred to another store, as he already covered shifts at other stores. i was told that it couldn't happen because it would be a form of retaliation against him.
from that point on, there was a corporate investigation for months. i continued working at the store, as did my harasser, our store manager scheduled us at different times to prevent overlap. still, he would show up to work early or stay late due to understaffing, and he always ended up in my proximity. i often would have panic attacks before going into the store if i saw his car in the parking lot.
weeks go by, and he makes a ""joke"" about ""punching me in the fucking face"" in front of another worker, and dave suspends him.
ultimately, i don't know the details of what happened post-suspension. i did receive a call saying my claims were found to be substantiated, but i wasn't told what that meant going forward. by late june 2021, he was no longer employed by the company. i found out when a barista told me he was seen dropping off his store key.
in october of 2021, i was told by a reputable source from another store that not only does this former shift supervisor frequent this store, he asked to be re-hired. i was under the impression that he was banned from the stores because i have seen bans implemented for much less.
come december of 2021, while i'm working, the former supervisor comes in to pick up his tips and sees me and vice versa. my body immediately goes into fight or flight, and my co-workers are just as shocked. essentially, i had a panic attack, started crying, and told my manager i was going home because i didn't feel safe.
two months prior, i stepped down from the shift supervisor role because the stress negatively impacted me. on my last day as a shift supervisor, i was verbally and almost physically assaulted by a man in the cafe. i filed an incident report and texted my manager, and i had no choice but to finish my shift in tears. no one in management ever followed up with me about the assault.
in january of 2022, i asked to set up a time to speak with my store manager and dave about my concerns. dave never gave me a solid time and ambushed me during my shift. we ended up having this conversation in the boh, where other employees overheard, even though i said i wasn't prepared to have that conversation.
i talked about how my mental health was negatively impacted and how i wasn't happy about how the situation was handled. i said it didn't make sense to me that a former shift supervisor was able to come into the store that he was fired from for sexual misconduct. dave told me he wasn't fired for those reasons but did not disclose why he was terminated. i also mentioned that management never followed up with me about my sexual harassment claim or the man in the cafe who assaulted me. dave was adamant that he followed up with me because he ""had it in his calendar.""
dave said he couldn't ban the former shift supervisor because ""if we ban him from this store, we have to ban him from all the stores."" he said it could be cause for him to retaliate. funny how every time i asked for measures to be exercised to protect me from this individual, it's considered to be retaliation. dave told me i could present a restraining order to enact a ban. i then was gaslit for the duration of the conversation and told to ""trust the system.""
i wasn't necessarily shocked by his lack of accountability. in march of 2020, during the onset of covid-19, i was working a shift, and we ran out of hot water. dave advised us to mix boiling water from the brewer with cold water and hand soap into a container we put iced coffee in to wash our hands. he told us to tell customers we couldn't serve food because ""the ovens were broken.""
not only is dave a sexual predator sympathizer, but he's also a liar and prioritizes sales over workers' best interests. he's the dirty car salesman of coffee.
ultimately, i decided the job was destructive to my mental health. i made a grueling decision to quit, forfeiting two years left of my scap scholarship with asu. i am now anticipating at-least three months of no health insurance as i wait for enrollment at my new job.
i started at 18 years old, trained over 15 baristas, opened two stores, built a rapport throughout the district, and was promoted to shift supervisor. i gave my literal blood, sweat, and tears to this place but was still treated poorly by management. this country has always upheld the reputations of predators, so at the time, it was very jarring to me that this progressive and value-driven company was no different.
to dave, i genuinely fear what kind of precedent you're setting as a father in your home, and i hope you're dealt with accordingly.",1663185101,sbux fail trenta size rant 266 sign month quit job

more little coaching things went on throughout the day that basically overwhelmed my green bean. i feel like, as their trainer, if anyone has any concerns about things the green bean is doing wrong that those concerns should be brought to me and i can find a way to coach that to my green bean. instead, i feel like the whole store is just taking it upon their shoulders to coach them each in their own way and it's stressing my trainee out. am i in the right? do y'all barista trainers have any experience with this issue? and help and insight would be greatly appreciated.",1663177591,barista trainer want weigh hey barista trainer bit a struggl green bean train almost a panic attack today amount of peopl coach breath neck in the store a shift even pull them asid and talk to them 5 minut about need them to stick the front regist and pop the back to grab syrup ice etc a bar partner came to check in on order my green bean ring and instead of help them understand that press the add ice button for a ice tripl espresso decid would best they reach their shoulder and made the chang to the drink on the po littl coach thing went on throughout the day that basic overwhelm my green bean i feel like their trainer if anyon ani concern about thing the green bean wrong that concern be brought to and i find a way to coach that to my green bean instead i feel like the whole store is take it upon their shoulder to coach them in their way and it stress my traine i in the right y all barista trainer ani experi issu and help and insight would be greatli appreci

2570,0,"venti rant about my (college campus) store hello starbucks reddit. today i come with a major concern i've had ever since i started working at my college campus's store. so i started working at starbucks in the summer, but bc of my class schedule and lack of transportation (i have to share the car with my mom and we almost always had the same shifts so it would be either one of us driving and the other taking a lyft, most of my shifts were midday so i couldn't take advantage of the free rides). anyway. i had to quit to apply to my store on campus, and i honestly didn't want to, i loved my manager and everyone there.
i just started this past monday, and... i don't want to sound like i'm a know-it-all but that store is so disorganized. there's a shift supervisor in training who doesn't know how to make fraps and the rest of the closing shift she's just wiping the counters. there's no fixed positions. i thought it would be different when i came yesterday for the midday. there was no shift supervisor, my coworkers just said i do ""what's available"". so i went on the register. mind you, i was pretty quick with all the orders and that usual long ass line of 20+ people was now 5 people waiting to get their order in. however, there were people waiting 10+ minutes to get their order, and i feel really bad bc the drinks are not standard made. to give you an example: they put the refreshers directly in the cup, no shaking, no nothing, nada. and since our customers are college students they gotta take whatever bs they're served bc they got class or are in a rush to somewhere and can't bother stay longer to complain bc it already takes too long to get a matcha latte moai
listen, correct me if i'm wrong, but for refreshers you put all the contents in the shaker, and shake. not put the stuff in the cup then put it in the shaker (which they did... sometimes, very few times actually). another thing... they don't sequence. people saw me deliver 3 drinks at once, they were giving drinks 1 at a time... moai so no wonder why people always complain that the line takes too long.
next, the closing shift on monday was too long. we should have been able to have everything clean by 10/10:30, just ring some last orders and close at 11. but because no one is delegated any task, people just do what they think they should do. no one has done the cabinets, and yesterday i felt bad bc one of the supervisors (for the food stations on campus) came to order some drinks and pointed out that our registers were dusty... tell me how we got 4+ baristaa doing drinks and we still have a long ass line (we don't even have a drive thru, thank god bc with how things are run, that would be my 13th reason). the manager knew i had worked for starbucks in the summer, and it feels like i'm the most experienced in that store (but to put it into perspective i've only worked at starbucks for 2 months, some of thess people have been working at the campus store for years... i'm trying to meet with the manager and express my concerns but before i do i want to make sure i am in the right here, and if you could advice me how to go over these issues without it sounding like ""i know better, i should run the store"" bc no, i don't know better, i'm just doing part time, and i won't offer to be a shift supervisor bc i know that takes training and weekly meetings which i would probably not be able to go to with how packed my schedule is (i'm studying to be a teacher and i have to do in-person observations for my courses, add the clubs i'm in, and the other classes, i barely make time to work and study).
there is a lot of other stuff too i could mention, like how everyone leaves the milks outside the fridge and without the cap... i'm not joking, i've had to ask for 2% milk 10+ times during each shift i've been so far. bc they keep moving it around, because no one restocks until were fully out of the last bottle of milk... like i said, i'm honestly really stressed by this situation and i wonder what i can do or what the manager can do to fix this. idk what the training is for the new s.s. but she doesn't even know her fraps, she's very sweet with me, and again none of this is personal but i can't just put a blind eye to the fact that this store is running by the grace of god or smth bc if it was an actual store i bet karens would have drowned it and put it to rest.",1663166075,venti rant colleg campu store hello reddit today come major concern i ever sinc i start work my colleg campu store i start work at starbuck summer bc my class schedul lack of transport i share the car with my mom and almost alway had the shift so would either one of us drive and the take a lyft of my shift midday so i take advantag of the free ride anyway i had to quit to appli to my store campu and i honestli t want to i love my manag and everyon i start past monday and i t want to sound like i a know it but store so disorgan there s a shift supervisor in train t know to make frap and the rest of the close shift s just wipe the counter there s fix posit i thought it would be differ i came yesterday the midday there no shift supervisor my cowork just said i s avail so i went on the regist mind i wa pretti quick with all the order and that usual long ass line of 20 peopl wa 5 peopl wait to get order in howev there were peopl wait 10 minut to get their order and i feel realli bad bc the drink standard made to give you exampl put the refresh directli in the cup no shake no noth nada and sinc custom are colleg student they gotta take whatev bs they serv bc they got class are in a rush to somewher and t bother stay longer to complain bc it alreadi take long to get a matcha latt moai listen correct i m wrong but for refresh you put all the content in the shaker and shake not put the stuff in the cup put it in the shaker they sometim time actual anoth thing they don t sequenc peopl saw me deliv 3 drink at they were give drink 1 at a time moai so no wonder peopl alway complain that the line take too long next the close shift on monday wa too long we have abl to have everyth clean 10 10 30 just ring last order and close at 11 but no one is deleg task peopl just do what they think they should do no one done the cabinet and yesterday i felt bad bc one of the supervisor for the food station on campu came to order some drink and point that our regist were dusti tell me how we got 4 baristaa drink and we still have a long ass line we don t even have a drive thru thank god bc with how thing are run that would be my 13th reason the manag knew i had work for starbuck in the summer and it feel like i m the most experienc in that store but to put it perspect i ve work at starbuck for 2 month some of thess peopl have been work at the campu store for year i m tri to meet with the manag and express my concern but i do i want to make sure i in the right and if you could advic me how to go issu without it sound like i know better i should run the store bc no i don t know better i m just do part time and i t offer to be a shift supervisor bc i know that take train and weekli meet which i would probabl not be abl to go to with how pack my schedul is i m studi to be a teacher and i have to do in person observ for my cours add the club i m in and the other class i bare make time to work and studi there is a lot of other stuff too i could mention like how everyon leav the milk outsid the fridg and without the cap i m not joke i ve had to ask for 2 milk 10 time shift i ve been so far bc they keep move it around becaus no one restock were fulli out of the last bottl of milk like i said i m honestli realli stress by thi situat and i wonder what i can do or what the manag can do to fix thi idk what the train is for the new s s but she doesn t even know frap she s veri sweet with me and none of thi is person but i can t just put a blind eye to the fact that thi store is run by the grace of god or smth bc if it wa an actual store i bet karen would have drown it and put it to rest

2632,0,"advice involving insurance? i'm a trans partner that has a surgery date set months ago for the end of this month, only waiting on my starbucks advocate to process it on their end for my surgeon's office to clear it and move on to the next step, only to find that they won't approve it at the very last minute, each time i called in there was a different excuse.
first, benefits are changing in october, so it had to be done before then. so, i found a surgeon willing to do it before then.
then, i find out that while on a medical leave from another surgery i was recovering from, they cancelled my insurances due to unpaid premiums at the literal earliest possible moment (end of june, my last worked month). my disability payments through sedgewick were nearly 2 months late, leaving me unable to pay the premiums, but also unable to pick up my hrt. my return to work date was aug. 22 or so, but i was put on a new unapproved loa by accident by sedgewick. i finally get through to the benefits center to reinstate my policies, but it takes forever and i keep getting tossed back and forth for days, despite calling in as early as possible.
then, my advocate tells me that i still haven't paid my premiums (which i did, and correct them) and then they say that was a mistake but it's still too late because today coincidentally they are given the order to refuse all surgeries, so my ffs isn't going to be covered at all.
tl;dr a series of mistakes on their end results in me coincidentally being delayed over and over for weeks until today they randomly with no warning decide they won't cover anything for the rest of the month. now what do i do? it seems so unfair; i did everything i could and this was my entire life.",1663110794,advic involv insur tran partner a surgeri date set month ago end month wait advoc process on end for my surgeon offic to clear it move on to the next step onli to find that approv it the last minut time i call a differ excus first benefit chang in octob it to done so i found a surgeon will to it befor then then i find that on a medic leav anoth surgeri i wa recov from they cancel my insur due to unpaid premium at the liter earliest possibl moment end of june my last work month my disabl payment sedgewick nearli 2 month late leav unabl to pay the premium also unabl to pick my hrt my return to work date wa aug 22 so but i wa put on a new unapprov loa accid by sedgewick i final get through to the benefit center to reinstat my polici but it take forev and i keep get toss back and forth for day despit call in earli as possibl then my advoc tell me that i still t paid my premium i and correct and then they say that wa a mistak but it s still late today coincident they are given the order to refus surgeri so my ff t go to be cover at all tl dr a seri of mistak on their end result in me coincident delay and over for week today they randomli warn decid they won t cover anyth for the rest of the month do i do it seem so unfair i did everyth i could and thi wa my entir life

2635,0,"are baristas supposed to be robots? so i've been working at starbucks for about 4 or 5 months now and i'm constantly having to sit down and get talked down to by my manager. in the past couple of months i've had problem on top of problem on top of problem happening at home regarding family and the death of my pet.
my manager always has something to say about my attitude or the way i come into work or how i work.
i work opening shifts and before this job i've never had to wake up that early before. i was always getting up at 9 am rather than 4 am in the morning.
recently she's said this:
1. when i come into work, even if im tired and mentally/emotionally exhausted, i should greet all of my coworkers and say good morning and get right to work.
2. i can't do dishes during peak (which i haven't done for the past 2 weeks. i'm trying not to piss anyone off and just stay out on the floor as much as possible)
3. i have to stop being disrespectful to my shift leaders. ( everyone assumes i'm being disrespectful when i forget to acknowledge them when they ask me to do something. usually during peak. i get so stressed out i forget to tap the headset to acknowledge them. sometimes i even forget to put my headset back on as our front/cs because i'm constantly taking orders up front and forget to put it back on.)
4. no drinks on the floor. i usually just drink water but sometimes when we get a second rush and i just made a drink for myself, i don't have time to run it back there. or i'm so cold in the mornings now that i ask if it's okay for me to just drink a hot tea. my shifts usually tell me it's fine and i don't have any other drinks out.
to put it basically, i'm told we're supposed to be a team and i need to be here for my team and tough things out, but i have so much going on that i feel like i've got no one to really speak to about my issues. toughing it out, is exactly what i've been doing and it's not enough anymore. i feel like i'm being told to push every emotion aside and only have a smile/chipper attitude while i'm working, even with my coworkers. they always have something to complain about when it comes to me. everything i do isn't good enough i feel like.

the situation here is that i've been working for the company for a year, but as a shift i still haven't finished my probation period (3 months) which ends in 2 weeks time. i've been reading the contract and all the booklets they give you when you are hired, and i find it to be quite confusing.

2670,0,"grande rant w/ an extra shot okay so on sunday i soloed dt and i was already a little annoyed because there were so many cars (like i was on dt for over 4 hours before i got my break and i had a 5 hour shift) and it was hour 2. but, this woman comes and orders a venti caramel frap w/ a shot, extra caramel, and bunch of other mods i don't remember and then orders some cake pops and says something along the lines of ""i want another of the same drink"" so i pressed copy drink.
then she says, ""can you split it into two tall cups?"" and i said, ""no, but i can give you two tall cups!"" (because that's what i was told the policy was from my ssv's) and then she says, ""no. i always get it split in two cups!"" or something and then i think i said well... or okay and then my sm comes in on the headset and says something like ""you just wanted the drink split into two cups? oh that's fine!"" and the woman is like "" yeah because it's for two kids and i don't want all the extra caramel in there"" and then says she didn't want the coffee in there either which makes sense obviously but that's not my problem. so then my sm just took over that whole order and i was so irritated.
like 1, that's not our policy so why are you trying to make it look like i'm in the wrong and idk what i'm doing when that's not even what we're supposed to do? because if she comes back and gets the same thing and someone else who got told the same thing tells her that we can't and you're not there, she's probably gonna be really mad and make a scene.

i've personally tried this trick and love the hell out of it. it's more consistent with less hot water eyeballing, and it also enables you (depending on your store setup) to keep all of the product needed to make this around the bar area.
if you run out of honey blend and you have to use packets, you can keep your honey packets on top of your machine. the heat it naturally produces will help liquify them. finally, i make something called ""scissor tea."" if the scissors get sticky, i just put them in a cup of hot water and they're cleaned and sanitized in one quick step.

point of my story: please welcome new and borrowed partners and communicate with them as it really makes a huge difference. also, at my normal store a lot of my co workers and even store manager will misgender me. i already have extreme dysphoria and struggle constantly, please lookout and use the correct pronouns for partners, we will respect you 110% for it as well as appreciate the validation and respect more than anything. i already deal with every person constantly challenging my existence, i just want to be able to go to work and atleast be respected and welcomed by my co workers there.

i'm a barista trainer, a shift supervisor, a coffee master, i won the district barista championship twice, i'm applying to be an asm. i can taste the difference between a shaken drink and a nonshaken drink, and i do like enforcing the starbucks standard to shake drinks (refreshers, teas, espressos, y'know.) not because i hate the people i correct, but i feel bad for customers who pay for and expect a drink to be made right and its not. refreshers taste different. i make myself an unshaken refresher after work because i'm lazy and i get disappointed that i didn't shake it because the bottom is too sweet and warm, and the top is all water and cold. not to mention, shaking the drinks cuts down on the ""well the other store shakes it and it tastes better"" or ""this tastes wrong, do it again"" complaints if we just do it right the first time.
but. every time someone orders a ""veentay brown milk shaken sugar oatmeal expresso drink"" with ""no ice, i try asking for light ice but you always put way too much so i guess i'll just get no ice"" because they want to drink a big cup of milk, i'm not shaking it. the pressure from the steam fills the shaker, the lid pops off, it burns me, makes a mess, theres no point. without ice, the flavor doesn't change. you get 4 espresso shots, a shake of cinnamon, some brown sugar and 26 ounces of oat milk. that's over half a carton of oat milk!!! there is no way their stomachs don't hurt after drinking that much milk. i tried recommending a latte but i'm the moron who knows nothing about starbucks or coffee and purposely fills their cup with ice because i'm evil. whatever, make the moment right i guess.

this particular one i'm not sure if i can call ""negative"", it was more baffling than anything else.
a lot of the details are fuzzy because it happened a couple years ago.
so it was a slow day, probably a weekend. i was at the register when a man came in with his kid, who was probably around 8-10ish. the guy comes up to me and orders ""a small hot chocolate, half milk"".
i had never heard of ""half milk"" before, so i had no idea what that instruction meant. i tried to get him to elaborate. did he want it made with half milk, half hot water? did he mean nonfat/skim milk??
guy was not having it. every question i tried to ask was answered with, ""no, half milk. half milk!!!"" he just kept saying ""half milk"" over and over again.
after a minute or two of me trying to figure out what the hell this guy was talking about, he throws up his hands in disgust and storms out with his kid, without ordering anything.
i asked my coworkers about this, they had no idea what that was about either. to this day, i still have no idea what ""half milk"" means. is this a regional thing? the guy seemed to be a native english speaker, so i don't think it was a case of something getting lost in translation.",1663005425,half milk stori use work a year ago i like well enough i like cowork i few realli neg custom experi particular one i sure i call neg it baffl anyth els a lot of detail fuzzi it happen a coupl year ago so it wa a slow day probabl a weekend i wa at the regist a man came kid wa probabl around 8 10ish the guy come to and order a small hot chocol half milk i had never heard of half milk so i had idea instruct meant i tri to get to elabor want it made with half milk half hot water did he mean nonfat skim milk guy wa not it everi question i tri to ask wa answer with no half milk half milk he kept say half milk and over a minut two of me tri to figur what the hell thi guy wa talk he throw up hi hand in disgust and storm out with hi kid without order anyth i ask my cowork about thi had no idea what that wa about either to thi day i still no idea what half milk mean thi a region thing the guy seem to a nativ english speaker so i think it wa a case of someth get lost in translat

2763,0,"written up for having a pre-existing condition i had a full spinal reconstructive surgery when i was 15 due to a severe case of scoliosis. being on my feet and working the food service industry is my passion, and if i take care of myself, this is normally not an issue. or hasn't been in years at least.
our store is severely understaffed right now. we also have a new out hired manager who is not qualified for this job.
yesterday i asked to come in a bit later than 7am (which was my scheduled time) because i was having severe back pain from working 7 days straight, having one day off, then working 6 straight days again. (also i was not asked if i was able to be scheduled that much, they just did it without making sure it was ok with me or the 2 other ssvs it's happened to)
(i have been working in the food service industry for 12+ years now. i always let my management know about my back. i even let my district manager know.)
i was told i can't come in late because 2 other people called off, and it was just my manager and a trainee working. i ended up calling out because i told both my manager and my dm that i am uncomfortable working such short staffed with this back pain and would be risking hurting myself more and calling out if i really threw my back out and missing more work than necessary. these flare ups happen two to three times a year, and again, they know. i have never called out for it before as i started working here last november.
my dm wanted to fire me for it, but my sm ended up fighting for me and i got written up instead.
this has been hurting me for about a week, and last thursday i was very vocal about my pain but did not ask to go home or leave early, but genuinely felt unsupported by the other staff working and strained my back even more.
basically my question is, am i able to fight a write up? i was trying to get transferred because this store is chaotic and it's just too much. also was supposed to start the asm program but now can't for 6 months. is there a way to fight this or am i sol?",1663001745,written pre exist condit a full spinal reconstruct surgeri i 15 due a sever case scoliosi feet work food servic industri my passion and i take care of is normal issu year least store is sever understaf right also a new hire manag is not qualifi for thi job yesterday i ask to come in a bit later 7am wa my schedul time i wa have sever back pain work 7 day straight have one day work 6 straight day also i wa not ask if i wa abl to schedul much without make sure it wa ok or the 2 ssv it happen to i have been work in the food servic industri for 12 year now i alway let my manag know my back i even let my district manag know i wa told i t come in late becaus 2 other peopl call off and it wa just my manag and a traine work i end up call out becaus i told my manag and my dm that i uncomfort work short staf with thi back pain and would be risk hurt myself and call out if i realli threw my back out and miss more work than necessari flare up happen two to three time a year and again they know i have never call out for it i start work last novemb my dm want to fire me for it my sm end up fight for me and i got written up instead thi been hurt me for about a week and last thursday i wa vocal about my pain but did not ask to go home or leav earli but genuin felt unsupport the other staff work and strain my back even more basic my question is am i abl to fight a write up i wa tri to get transfer becaus thi store is chaotic and it s just much also wa suppos to start the asm program but now can t for 6 month is a way to fight thi or am i sol

2806,0,"psa to (unionized) partners helping out at other stores hey ya'll. first off, i wanna say that i strongly support the union movement. i am so here for it. i appreciate and admire everything you guys are doing.
i had a borrowed partner at my store today; they were from a unionized store and they were helping us out because we have a lot of sick partners right now. we aren't unionized. our store is busy af ($9000+/day) but we have an amazing manager and we are in a good place. it was super kind of that partner to come and help us out on a sunday.
however. when you come help as a borrowed partner and then start to point out to me (the keyholder), my manager, and anyone else who will listen what is ""wrong"" with our store, you are not doing a good thing. you are not making a good impression. you are hurting the union movement.
please remember that to these nonunionized partners, you are the face, the embodiment of the union movement (especially if you are wearing sbux workers united pins, etc). some of them have probably never met anyone, let alone worked with anyone, from a unionized store. we must lead by example to show people the way, and criticizing their workplace organization/tasking structure/etc the first time you work there is rude and inconsiderate. several of my partners approached me after the borrowed partner left to explain their frustration around this situation.
this kinda goes for any partners helping out at other stores. you mold to what that store does for the time that you're there. if you don't like that, don't work at other stores.

2840,0,"i just read a post on a starbucks facebook group from a barista who was left to cry in the bathroom of her starbucks, because a customer thought they were entitled to yell at, scream at, cuss out the barista. over what, you ask? because the customer ordered a drink that came out to $7.00 usd after the mods they had requested -- because the customer was too lazy to look up the price on the website or app before ordering, and because they're ignorant or unwilling to learn that it's corporate, not the baristas that are setting these prices.
i will never understand what crawls up someone's ass and dies, and makes them come into a place of business... then have the audacity treat speak to the workers like they're literal garbage, whether something is the workers' fault or not.
even if the drink that you as a customer insist on having 85 mods to barista accidentally forgets one, or you don't like the price because you're too stupid or lazy to look up the prices, you have zero right to take it upon yourself to speak to another human being like they're literal garbage and deserve to be your verbal punching bag. they are human beings, just like you as the customer, and under zero circumstances is it okay to treat them with anything less than kindness and respect.
and if at any point you feel that treating another human being who is serving you like garbage like they deserve to be scream at and cussed at, then i have one piece of advice for you. it is a sage piece of advice that i have used for years when i feel like i am about to lose my shit on someone who absolutely does not deserve it for things that are beyond their control. you have absolutely got to step back and say to yourself in a really firm, almost snappy voice because you deserve it, ""be fucking nice!!"" trust me, it is much more effective for both of you, and it will get you much further. it would also cause your entitle ass not to scream at your servers baristas and make them feel less than, or ruining their entire day because your stupid ass drink ""isn't made correctly"" or made up to your ""standards"". another way to look at it, is that if you're being a complete asshole to your servebarista, they're going to be a lot less willing (mentally and motivationally) to help you, because you have already taken everything out of them over to your screamfest temper tantrum.
i left a job because of customers like that, who thought they were free to talk to me like i was literal garbage as soon as i said something relevant to their claim they didn't like, or that the policy didn't cover them for this, that, or the other. customers that would raise their voices at me, swear at me, make threats to me, and behave like an uncivilized human being. in fact, i have become a walking billboard as to why people should not work that position.",1662924108,read post a facebook group a barista left cri bathroom starbuck a custom thought entitl to yell scream at cuss the barista ask becaus the custom order a drink came out to 7 00 usd the mod they request becaus the custom wa lazi to look the price on the websit app order becaus they ignor or unwil to learn that corpor the barista that set price i never understand what crawl up someon s ass and die and make come a place of busi the audac treat speak to the worker like they re liter garbag whether someth the worker fault or not even the drink that you a custom insist on 85 mod to barista accident forget one or you like the price becaus you re too stupid or lazi to look up the price you have zero right to take it upon to speak to anoth human like they re liter garbag and deserv to verbal punch bag they are human be just like you as the custom and zero circumst is it okay to treat them anyth less kind and respect and if at point you feel that treat anoth human be who is serv you like garbag like they deserv to be scream at and cuss at then i have one piec of advic you it is a sage piec of advic that i have use for year i feel like i to lose shit on someon who absolut not deserv it for thing that are beyond control you have absolut got to step back and say to yourself in a realli firm almost snappi voic becaus you deserv it be fuck nice trust it is much effect for of you and it will get you much it would also caus your entitl ass not to scream at your server barista and make them feel less than or ruin their entir day becaus your stupid ass drink t made correctli or made up to your standard anoth way to look at it is that if you re be a complet asshol to your servebarista they re go to be a lot less will mental and motiv to help you becaus you have alreadi taken everyth out of them over to your screamfest temper tantrum i left a job becaus of custom like that who thought they were free to talk to me like i wa liter garbag as soon as i said someth relev to their claim they t like or that the polici didn t cover them for that or the custom that would rais their voic at me swear at me make threat to me and behav like uncivil human be in fact i have becom a walk billboard as to peopl not work that posit

trans woman, 23, diagnosed with gender dysphoria at 4, transitioned at 16/17 medically at 18.
i have had ky medicaid my whole life which covered hrt bottom surgery. nothing more. i got tricare in 2020 which essentially is a fight for hormones alone, no other surgeries being offered.
i have my consultation for breast augmentation on the 30th as i was going to pay for it myself, however, discovering my surgeon accepts aetna, i went the starbucks route.
i had my interview today, 100% getting hired, will know for sure on monday.
my issue is, i have no idea what is going on with starbucks insurance, the new policy changes, or what exactly i need to do step-by-step wise.
i already have letters from therapists referring me for surgery, 4-5 years hrt, 7 years living as the preferred gender, the criteria is met.
what do i need to do to, once i'm hired working 20 hours a week minimum, to make a breast augmentation happen. will i choose my plan that my surgeon accepts (aetna) and be enrolled in that on december 1st (1st day of the month following 2nd month?) will i then have the green light to schedule?
my surgeon is an hour away at the states largest hospital so i assume he would be considered in network if that is what the policy change is about.
would love to just hear your tips or experience timeline really learn as much as i can before i begin nothing management trans advisors (i don't even know what those are!)
tldr - how long after start date until coverage is able to be used for surgery, criteria is already met prior, tips for step-by-step to make this happen as quickly as possible.

apparently we should be immediately putting the tickets onto bags, which isn't a problem until there is a food rush. all of the bags can't fit onto the small counter for larger food orders, i end up throwing the wrong food into the oven/not throwing 2 items of the same thing because they printed at different times, and it takes more time overall. i hate warming so much because of how small of a space i have to work with+the volume of morning customers ordering 3+ food items.

3028,0,"advice needed - rehire back in 2020, my husband got fired from the bux for money that went missing. he was a brand new shift and had only been running shifts for maybe a month after getting only about two days of supervisor training before being thrown onto the floor. anyway, money went missing and the dm immediately stepped in and fired him. not the sm, the dm. there were no write-ups, no warnings, no questions, nothing. my husband did not steal anything. he marked out all of his food, his drinks, everything by the book.
my husband came in for his shift one day to find the dm in the back with someone from corporate on the phone. she (dm) told all the other partners to stay out of the back room. they told him money was missing and supposedly they traced it back to him. my husband, not knowing what was happening, followed along and signed the papers put in front of him. afterwards, the dm told him he'd be eligible for rehire in the future but for now they can't keep him. they then made him leave out the back door and told him not to tell anyone what happened (including the sm).
we were later served with a legal notice to pay it back ($120 or so) or face further legal action, and we immediately paid it to their lawyer.

3050,0,"why i care about standards i do not care about starbucks. i do not think most of the stuff we sell is any good, and absolutely none of it is worth what they charge. when someone is doing a hack to save money i am not being robbed. but let me tell you why i care about standards.
i care about standards because this is a big chain with many locations in each geographical area. that means most customers visit more than one starbucks in their area. they might have a regular store they visit, but maybe also one by work or one by the shopping center or whatever.
i do not care about the customer's experience. i do not care that it is consistent. this is not why i care about standards.
what i care about is the customer's *expectations*, and how that can impact my fellow workers at stores that are not my own. now the customer, you must understand, is a low-intelligence, high-demand creature, one that lives largely on sugars and foams. these customers, little more than feral sugar pursuers, do not know what is in their drinks, do not know how their drinks are made, do not usually even know the actual names of their drinks. but what they do know is that if one store lets them make a fake latte by getting two shots in a grande cup, light ice, fill it with half and half, they will come to expect that. what they do know is that if one store lets them get their americano in a trenta cup, they will expect that.
now, when that customer heads to another store, a store where perhaps the employees stick to standards, that customer will - more likely than not! - become a monstrous pain in the ass to the low-paid worker who is just trying to make a drink the way they were taught to make a drink.
what this means is that a barista at location a, by training their customers that they can get whatever they want however they want, is making the life of a barista at location b much, much harder.
standards supposedly exist to give customers a standard experience across all stores, but for me they exist to protect my fellow workers - they are the ones who will bear the brunt of the fury of the monster i create when i break standards for a customer. my greatest fear is becoming the person the customer is talking about when they say ""the other starbucks does it for me all the time."" i never want to be the other starbucks.
standards matter not for the company or for the customer. standards matter for us.",1662741806,care standard i care about i do not think stuff sell good absolut none of is worth charg someon is hack save money i not rob let tell whi i care about standard i care about standard is a big chain mani locat geograph area mean most custom visit one starbuck in area they might a regular store they visit but mayb also one work one by the shop center or whatev i do not care about the custom experi i do not care that it is consist thi is not whi i care about standard what i care about is the custom s expect and that impact fellow worker store that not my the custom you must understand is a low intellig high demand creatur one that live larg sugar and foam custom littl more than feral sugar pursuer do not know what is in their drink do not know how their drink are made do not usual even know the actual name of their drink but what they do know is that one store let make a fake latt by get two shot in a grand cup light ice fill it with half and half they come to expect that what they do know is that if one store let them get their americano in a trenta cup they will expect that now when that custom head to anoth store a store perhap the employe stick to standard that custom will more like than not becom a monstrou pain in the ass to the low paid worker is tri to make a drink the way they taught to make a drink what thi mean is that a barista at locat a by train their custom that they can get whatev they want howev they want is make the life of a barista at locat b much much harder standard supposedli exist to give custom a standard experi across store but me they exist to protect my fellow worker they are the one who will bear the brunt of the furi of the monster i creat when i break standard for a custom my greatest fear is becom the person the custom is talk about when they say the starbuck it for me all the time i never want to the other starbuck standard matter not for the compani or for the custom standard matter for us

there are donuts to keep track of and sandwich recipes to remember on top of drinks, at least at sbux you guys have drinks and toss food items in the oven. uniform rules include no nose rings/face piercings (not that bad i can wear a clear), no tattoos showing (again not a huge issue), no unnatural coloured hair (this one just makes me sad). but i can honestly live with that.

had a lady hold up the drive through and get mad today because i made one of my partners have her tell us what the recipe was for a cotton candy frappuccino. i had partners looking at me like i was crazy because several of us knew what it was and could make it, no problem.
and if you're annoyed at me too, then you're part of the problem. i'm protecting our green beans, and i'm protecting those that just don't know. the minute you say ""oh, i can make that for you, of course"" you're making that customer think it's a drink on the actual menu. and then situations like today arise.
""well the last time i came here they knew how to make it, and i didn't have to go to all this trouble. this is stupid.""
that is the reaction it breeds when someone new doesn't know what they're talking about. and it might make me petty or just a bad ssv, but i make every barista stick to their guns and ask every single time, no matter if they know it or not. people need to stop coming in and ordering a chocolate covered strawberry, or a captain crunch. i don't know how to make those, and just because linda at the store on the other side of town knew, doesn't mean that i do.

first, i would like to say sorry for my language and tone in this,
it is 12:19 am as of now, and my blood has been boiling.
our payday was friday of last week,
i had just finished training and, me and my manger came to the conclusion my dob was entered wrong, however he assured me that wasn't a issue, and we moved on.
now, that was fixed, then on friday, my check never went into my bank account. after i messaged him about this, he told me he would take time and look into it in the coming morning. now 2 days later, i text him back about it, and he finally responded saying to log into our work computer to go to the partner hub. i attempted to log in and after attempting a password reset upon login, it said ""invalid pb1085 id"" or something like that, that isn't exactly what it said but somewhat close.
then we hung up and he said he would have to fix it, got a text about sending him a picture of my id and said everything should be fixed.
now it was labor day weekend so that didn't help in reliving my stress. so i was told i would have to wait till monday (labor day) for him to file a emergency pay out. he said it would take 1-2 processing days, (another kick to my side)
so yesterday it was supposed to be in my bank. i use navy federal credit union so i get my check a day early. so that was the next kick yesterday at 12am. i have been up the past nights waiting and seeing and it is driving me fuckin crazy. my blood is boiling, i have been busting my ass trying to work hard and long.

once in a long while, my coworkers will text me to do a check-in and see how life is going, but now, they only texted me when they want their shift covered or help because people called out. because of that, i lost all my faith in everyone and became anti-social when i was working. there was also some tea like i secretly know one of the partners romantically liked me (i am just 20 and i have school;-;). it's not a bad thing but it does creep me out because i often work with her.

halfway through my shift today, i was solo-ing drive and handling warming, when these girls show up in a tiny sports car. since we have maintenance going on behind the bar, i'm having a bit of trouble hearing them and already starting to irritate them with the constant ""can you repeat that one more time for me?""
it ended up being 4 drinks, all different overly customized versions of blended refreshers. at that point get a frap. but whatever.
when they get to the window, i already have their food items ready (not to mention a whole bunch at warming waiting to be made). then, every drink i give them, there's an issue with.
""there isn't enough car drizzle on this one""
""this one had sccf""
""i didn't want this lid""
etc etc etc
everyone on bar is annoyed, i'm annoyed, the ovens are beeping like crazy, and i can hear them snickering in their car. plus my ssv has me open their order back up and charge them for their extra vssc, which i understand, but was an awful way to end the interaction as they swore up and down their already paid for the vssc (until they got their receipt of course).
after this was over, i handed them their items, straws napkins etc, and went to clear the transaction from my screen. no extra pleasantries since our drive times were screwed enough as it was, when they paused their snickering to yell ""you have a good day *as well*"" in the nastiest voice i've ever heard on window

my manager has made comments a few times that i am falling behind the other girl, even having her ""supervise"" me making drinks. we work very similar hours, but usually different shifts, so technically, we should both be getting bar practice. but it does not seem to be the manager's priority to give me any, putting me on bar for 10-20 minutes in a 4 hours shift before sending me to clean bathrooms, hand out on drive or do customer support. my supervisors and manager are very strict about the plays and roles, so it's not like i can ask them to put me on bar longer.
when we were finishing training, our trainer told us that we wouldn't get much time on bar for the first few weeks as the previous two newbies needed that time. but now that the two new hires are out of the training modules and in the bar, the supervisor has been putting them on bar over me again, so i am still not getting practice.
it is beginning to make me wonder if they have already decided that they are going to fire me once the new people are trained. the jobs that they put me on need very little training, and it feels like they are just keeping me around as a helper until they can replace me with someone else. on top of that, i am not being given enough hours (no weekends despite being available) to reach benefits, which makes me even more suspicious that they aren't bothering to put that much effort into me because i won't be around long.
do you think i am reading too much into these behaviors, or have you seen something similar happen before with a new hire? i just keep waiting for the play caller to put me on bar, but it never comes. i'm beginning to feel a bit discouraged with the whole situation.
thanks for any feedback you can give me!",1662480105,replac hello barista i question ask of have store a seen new partner come and go i am a fairli new hire begin of last month and hire at time anoth girl two new hire us and there have been two sinc manag made comment a time i am fall behind the other girl even supervis make drink work similar hour usual differ shift technic we get bar practic but seem to be the manag prioriti to give me put me bar for 10 20 minut a 4 hour shift befor send me to clean bathroom hand on drive custom support my supervisor and manag veri strict the play and role so it s not like i ask to put me on bar longer we were finish train trainer told us that we get much time on bar for the first few week as the previou two newbi need that time but that the two new hire are out of the train modul and in the bar the supervisor ha been put them on bar me so i am still not get practic it begin to make me wonder have alreadi decid that they are go to fire me the new peopl are train the job that they put me on need veri littl train and it feel like they are keep me around as a helper they can replac me someon els on top of that i am not be given enough hour weekend despit be avail to reach benefit make me even suspici that they t bother to put that much effort me i t be around long do you think i am read much into behavior or have you seen someth similar happen befor with a new hire i just keep wait for the play caller to put me on bar but it never come i begin to feel a bit discourag with the whole situat thank for ani feedback you can give me

so i'm like 1.5 months on board, past training, and have been taught closing. i'm kind of frustrated because i am available all day 5 days a week, 6 coming soon. this said, store manager is still bringing in new hires and i just heard today they are looking for an opener. i only get scheduled 28 hours a week. i have mentioned in the nicest ways that i would live longer shifts.
when i covered for someone:
""hey i *really* appreciated the longer shift."" in a text.
when a customer asked if they were hiring and i heard about the opener shift, once they left i said:
""feel free to train me and i'd love to do it.""
at the end of closing today i told my sm a third time:
""i would really love to work longer hours,"" which got a silent smile and nod.
when i applied and interviewed for this job i said i was looking for as much of a full time schedule as possible. i take every opportunity to cover for people. i have had no complaints and when i asked how i was doing after initial training i was told i am above average for a new person. since then, i can work bars, cs, customer support, planted or not. i might ask one question a day about a drink i haven't heard of or a specialty order.
...yet we are bringing on 2 kids not old enough to work a full week by law, just finished training one before them, and apparently we need an opener.
i want large shifts, 8 hour shifts / 40 a week or as close as possible. what should i do? at this point i feel like i'm a bother by bringing it up.
the only thing i considered was that the sm told me at hiring that they try to keep people in training under 6 hours, but i'm not getting trained anymore. there are a few modules to do that are very obscure and sm hasn't made time for (due today actually). but i was also told that, as a person who wants starbucks health insurance, that the store prioritizes hours for those people. right now i'm going to *narrowly* make the 3 month consecutive hours to obtain insurance.
advice? i've been so direct to sm. when you make 15.50 an hour i don't get why we need sooooo many people. i'm here, i'm available, i've made it known. everyone likes me. do i share my interest with the district manager at this point? the only thing close to an acknowledgement my sm was after i told them i'd be available for an extra day come october, to which they replied, ""awesome! we need people on those days."" i don't get it.

3439,0,"not getting a straw-cup for drinks like an ice macchiato is criminal longtime starbucks drinker here...well, long-time, but infrequent. i only occasionally get a frappuchino or cold brew, but my favorite drink has been the caramel iced macchiato. well, it used to be, but ever since they started serving them in those straw-less cups, drinking one has been an existential nightmare.
i was reminded of this today when i got that new apple crisp iced macchiato. delicious, except the lack of a straw made it subpar. one of the things i love about some starbucks drinks is how layered they are, something relatively unique among most coffee places. having a straw lets you experience each layer as you desire. this is doubly true for anything with caramel or other heavy sauce in it, since it sinks to the bottom. you can use the straw to get a little bit of sweet syrupy goodness into your sip whenever you feel like it.
except with these (relatively) new cups, that's a thing of the past. you don't get to experience the layers, you just chug the espresso part until you get to the milk, unless of course you shake the whole thing until it becomes a completely different drink. and forget about tasting any of that syrup, it's gonna stick to the bottom of the cup the whole way through.
i literally never get these drinks on the go anymore, i can only have them when i've gotten home, and can use a spoon or something to experience each layer, and i don't to explain to anyone why that's a miserable experience.
surely, i can't be the only one who thinks the lack of a straw is ruining these drinks?",1662410458,get straw cup drink like ice macchiato crimin longtim drinker well long time infrequ occasion get a frappuchino cold brew but favorit drink caramel ice macchiato well use but ever sinc start serv straw less cup drink one ha been an existenti nightmar i remind today i got new appl crisp ice macchiato delici except the lack of a straw made it subpar one of the thing i love starbuck drink is layer they someth rel uniqu among coffe place a straw let experi layer you desir thi is doubli true for anyth caramel or heavi sauc in it sinc it sink to the bottom you use the straw to get a littl bit of sweet syrupi good sip whenev you feel like it except with rel new cup that a thing of the past you get to experi the layer you chug the espresso part you get to the milk unless of cours you shake the whole thing until it becom a complet differ drink forget about tast of that syrup it s gonna stick to the bottom of the cup the whole way i liter never get these drink the go anymor i can onli them when i gotten home and can use a spoon or someth to experi each layer and i don t to explain to anyon that s a miser experi sure i can t be the onli one think the lack of a straw is ruin these drink

they are not. i go in and order and they have it 9/10 times. so i asked about it the other day, wondering if someone forgot to turn it back on or something and the cashier said they turn it on every morning, and she doesn't know why the app is doing that, that maybe the quantities are off or something.
i didn't press it, just ordered my latte and went on my way.
i'm just annoyed that if i want oatmilk, which by far my preference for milks, i can't use the app, which is a bummer because it's super convenient.

3481,0,"it's been three years since i quit, and my mental health and sanity has gotten a lot better since i was a partner from 2015 to 2020, just before the pandemic hit (217xxxx partner).
what killed me about this job was the forced customer connections. me and the other partners are always being told by our store manager that we'll get fired if we don't improve our customer connections. i was always being told to sit down at customers tables and ask them what they're up to and how their drink is. my store manager would stand next to me, whispering in my ear ""tell her that her scarf looks nice"", ""they're on their phone, think of a way to get them to talk to you""). it was so draining.
my relationships with the regulars over the years started going downhill when they started to realize how forced the conversations were (me, panicking on bar during peak with sweat falling down my face: ""hi how was your day today?!"", them: ""good how are you"", me: good how are you"", them: ""you asked that already..."", woops).
over the years, i constantly felt depressed, and anxious. i always took work home. i was stuck in the barista position with no opportunity of moving up because my customer connections were bad. i would say 90% of the baristas and supervisors i've worked with were all dealing with severe anxiety too.
i now work at a movie theatre as a manager. the people at this job actually believes in me, and that's the best feeling ever. best of all, no forced customer connections, just a simple ""welcome! hope you enjoyed your show!"". i feel a lot more respected by the higher ups and the customers. no more going home overthinking ""damn that interaction with that customer earlier was so awkward, they're probably thinking about it"". no more scrubbing floors or toilets either.

i hope this is allowed. i see a lot of baristas on tiktok talk about their negative experiences being employed with starbucks and i wanted to share mine. this might be sorta long so thanks in advance if you choose to read.
i came to starbucks as a barista with several years of supervisory experience at another high-volume food chain. i trained at a different store than the one i was hired at and was noticed as a fast learner by management and other partners alike, with some even making ""undercover boss"" jokes because i didn't seem like a trainee. after about three months and with some encouragement from several shift supervisors at my store and the one i trained at, i applied to be a shift supervisor at my training store. i interviewed and got picked the same day, which meant more hours and a major pay raise for me, which i was in desperate need of because i had recently left a toxic relationship and i was financially devastated. i was so excited about this opportunity, it was everything i ever wanted!
the beginnings at my new store were rough. my first day went as planned with mostly computer-based training the whole day. the next day, another shift supervisor tested positive for covid-19 and went into isolation, along with several other partners and i believe another shift supervisor too. i was told i would be a regular barista for the week and my training would resume the following week, which was no big deal.
the following week, i thought my training would continue as planned. i thought i would finish the computer training, shadow a supervisor for the week, and then be on my own. on the first day of continuing my training, i came in for a mid-shift and was told i was actually running the floor. and so training was over. i had mentioned this to the asm and sm later on as i was concerned i wouldn't know everything and mess something up but they insisted i got my full training and i was fine.
i thought i did mostly well. a lot of other partners were really annoyed with my presence as they wanted my role (and deserved it more since they were far more seasoned). it was so intimidating because i felt like all eyes were on me and any question i asked about this store's particular setup (i couldn't remember from when i first trained there) and ss-related questions felt like i was being discredited and it was proof i wasn't qualified for my role. after a while, however, i think i grew on most of them and i even made some friends.
i was dedicated to my job. i loved it. i felt i went the extra mile quite often there. i covered others when i could, went in early/stayed late almost every time i could, and never had a problem switching with other shifts. i never gave any of my partners trouble about calling out/leaving early/whatever and always made it work even though i was only ever given just enough partners to make the store run with no ""wiggle room"" (if i lost one partner for the night it guaranteed complete chaos). i never turned away a barista that needed a ride home. being mainly a closing shift, i was the only authority in the building from 2 pm to close, and i had to deal with a lot of dangerous situations (unpredictable homeless people, drugs being done in the bathroom, etc.) but i always faced it.
things got sort of rocky about 2 months into this role. one of the shifts that also worked close showed me that when she comes in, she takes one till from each register and two from one of the front registers as you usually don't need it for the rest of the night, so i started doing that. on one shift where the asm worked with me for a few hours, he found out and scolded me. he had put that till back in and i had completely forgotten as i was so used to taking it out, so it stayed in the register overnight. not too long later, i had closed and left the cash pouch in the back, on the desk. that was my verbal warning. i was told i would receive a written warning next time, and if i made another mistake after that i would be terminated.
i was starting to stress. things in my personal life were also not great and my mental health was taking a nosedive. there were multiple occasions where i tried to get my shift covered because i just felt like i couldn't do it but management told me there were no shifts who could cover it as everyone was already at 40 hours. every time i worked i was terrified my next mistake was around the corner. i had asked management multiple times if i could switch to mids or mornings. i explained that i felt that nights were for more seasoned shifts as they work it alone with no other shift or manager to peer review. my store's opens usually had the sm, asm, and two shifts. our mid usually had one shift that overlapped with open and close but they had no open/close duties obviously. it just didn't feel fair that on top of not being properly trained, i had all this responsibility, and nobody was ever there to check that i wasn't missing anything. they told me there was just no way for me to not work closes. i tried to do my best with what i had and take a more positive outlook on things. i got myself a to-do list of the most important things to check, i was seeing a therapist through starbucks, and i felt like i was doing better.
it was clean play night. i had agreed to work every clean play in exchange for working two mids a week and being off on thursdays and fridays (which i never received). in the weeks prior i had been asking the asm if the morning shifts had any feedback for me on my clean plays as nobody ever left comments in the book. i never got trained on what to clean save for one night i did it alongside the sm, but we had a callout so he said we were going to half-ass it just this once. there weren't guides on store resources for every single thing listed on the clean play checklist. i was eager to know how to do everything in the store so i was constantly looking to improve. one of these days when i asked, the asm wanted to know what i didn't know so i asked him to show me how i'm supposed to clean the cold brew system and he basically just showed me to wipe down the top parts. this day, though, he told me he had feedback from the morning shifts and he listed a bunch of things not getting done, including the cold brew. he then gave me just a verbal walkthrough of the super complicated actual way you're supposed to clean it which was not what i was told by him before. he gave me a resource printout and was sure to leave at his scheduled time as always.
the night was super stressful, i tried to take apart and clean it myself but even though i did it as instructed it wasn't working. he tried to walk me through it over text but ultimately told me i had to leave it because it was clogged from not being cleaned correctly for weeks on end, which he definitely blamed me for. by the time he told me to give up and leave it for the morning, it was 11 and i still had to count drawers. by the time i was done, my partners had long been finished with their tasks and were waiting on me. as i was going to put the drawers in the safe, the bottom one slipped and they all spilled on the floor. in tears, i had to pick up the coins and recount everything. i told my partners to just go home. i know i wasn't supposed to be there alone but they had been waiting so long already. i finished around 12:30 i think and finally went home.
the next day, i was feeling much better. i had just finished the process of applying for the asu program, and i was feeling very thrilled about the opportunity to finish the biology degree that i've been trying to get for 4 years. immediately after i called and scheduled a meeting with an sm next to my boyfriend's house because i was moving and this store was looking for a morning shift. i was so thrilled.
but when i came in, i got fired. i had left the deposit bag on top of the pastry case ""overnight"" (opening shift comes in at 3:30 so for three hours) and therefore i needed to be automatically terminated, but i was welcome to apply anywhere as a barista after thirty days.
that was 5 months ago. i have applied to so many starbucks here so many times, i have called and talked to the sm's about my specific situation, asking to just be a barista, but they never moved forward with me. i have probably applied to at least 300 jobs since then and haven't landed a single one. i'm constantly on job boards looking for the next ad. i can't even doordash because my car is broken down and i can't afford to fix it so now i'm limited to remote jobs or jobs within walking distance. debt collectors are constantly calling me. i've had not a single dime for five months. i tried to apply for unemployment twice but starbucks fought it and won. i'm still grieving everything i lost; my job, my chance to go back to school, my path to financial stability. and i hate myself so so much for that negligent stupid mistake and now i'll never get redemption, and i still feel like i was let down by management who promised to support me in my journey but rarely lifted a finger for me when i needed it. i know i should be over it by now, but, you know... what i could have been. something so much different.",1662340187,termin stori tldr fire manag neglect my proper train i

as a customer im generally satisfied with the way you handle orders, most of the time its seamless and once i submit my mobile order i pick it up trough drive tru in 10 min or less, never had an issue and i've been ordering this way for more than a year.
fast forward to the past two months and for one reason or another i've opted to pick up the mobile order at the store instead of using drive tru, this has ""opened my eyes"" to the level of hauling ass you guys are doing just to keep up with everything at once, which got me thinking that this will eventually burn out employees since its non stop for a good chunk of their day.

3602,0,"what is the policy for remaking drinks with no proof of purchase? so, a lady came in saying she needed a remake for three venti frappuccinos with complicated additions (some of which we didn't have ingredients for and hadn't all week) because they made it wrong. i asked her if she came to this store and when, just to get more background so i could check the book, since my store keeps records of those who call for a remake and she said she had. i couldn't find any record of any remake that entire week and she didn't know who she had spoken to and didn't have a receipt in the app or physical, no cups, nothing. our store has a policy where we won't replace drinks that were made more than three days ago unless they call to let us know they won't be able to come in until then. come to find out she got it last friday (the day she said she got it changed twice, but this was the final answer) so i checked that week and sure enough it still wasn't anywhere there. to appease her, (because she said how dare i do this to her in front of her kids, who weren't paying attention in the back seat) i remade a different frap and split it into three cups, while she called me an ""idiot with absolutely no sense"" and other names and demanded my name, which i gave to her.
this all coming the day after a lady threatened (and then feinted throwing something at me while laughing) to throw a hot drink in my face (and laughed that i wouldn't be able to call the police because she would be long gone, she works in an er as a nurse btw) because i was trying to resolve her issue because she was mad a barista had told her please not to honk to get our attention (still in a polite voice) and got out of her car to demand an apology and she was going to call corporate, and she wanted her name, and i wouldn't give it to her and gave her my name instead because i was worried for that partner's safety. idk man i'm so tired of customers thinking they can treat baristas (or any person in customer service) like they own them and can do whatever they want to them and like we aren't real people with feeling just trying to do our jobs.
pro tip: if you are a customer reading this, we will go out of our way to help the people who are nice to us. if you are mean, you're probably the 50th person who treated us like trash and we're going to do the bare minimum. please, i don't want to hear all the ""well just find another job if you hate it"" comments. like, what? why don't you find a better attitude? we're paid to make a drink, not to be a verbal (sometimes physical) punching bag. who raised these people, and why didn't they learn empathy? it's not that hard to be nice, a lot of people take it every day. i understand being upset if your drink is wrong and your day was bad and this is the final straw, but at the end of the day, it's just coffee to you, even if we remember the cruel words said to us, long after. moral of the story just be nice

3603,0,"advice/help (venti rant too) i've been growing as a green bean and im proud of my growth. ive been put on bar most of my shifts but today i was put on brewing station/reg. the last time i was on this position was quite a while ago so i didn't really have a clue what to do. my ssv told me to prep the blonde pour over then proceeded to hand me an entire blonde veranda bag since we ran out of the cube. i assumed that they wanted me to grind the entire bag so i did, but when they found out, they got frustrated and grilled me for it. then they took me off reg to solely focus on brewing station (and i didnt know what to do since i havent done it in a long time. all my usual shifts start after the brewing station tasks are done too). i felt really stupid and like a kid.
i guess my question for this is: what am i supposed to do on brewing station? i know im supposed to watch the coffee but what else?
i am also a closer with this same ssv. dont get me wrong, they are a good person and they have well intentions, but they really have a way of treating me like im still a very new person. i am still learning but they treat me as a kid. it wasnt until my gm intervened where they finally left me alone on bar and left me alone to watch the floor. i think they low key hate me for that intervention which sucks. there will be times where i am working with another partner who has been here longer. id be doing the floors while ssv is in the back doing ssv things, so the partner is solo-ing when its dead and they'd be going back and forth for restocks, make more lemonade, get more inclusions etc and the ssv is fine with it. but when im solo-ing while its dead, the ssv grills me for ""leaving the floor empty"" (despite me taking around 10 seconds to go to the back then to the front). it's worse because the ssv will always tell me to start prepping inclucions, mocha, whipped creams and more while im solo-ing but none of the clean containers are on the floor which means i have to go to the back to get them, but i cant because im solo-ing. so me solo-ing is not productive with this rule.

3660,0,"one of my shift managers continuously makes me feel like i'm always doing something wrong or not good enough i've been working for nearly two months as a barista. i get a lot of positive feedback from other shift managers, i get kind corrections from them, i feel safe asking questions to them or just being open with them about my thought process and clarifying the root of where i messed up if i make a mistake. at this point, they all seem to trust that i know what i'm doing in a lot of areas, that i'll ask questions when i'm unsure, and they ask me if i know how to do certain things just in case they need to clarify anything before assigning me a task or so they can ask someone else if we're busy and someone else is more prepared/knowledgeable etc. i'm constantly doing work, never just standing idly and if i am it's for 7 seconds thinking about what i should be doing
but this one shift manager................. they tell me to do things i'm expected to do regularly, even if i've already done them. and in a way that i feel like i'm being talked at, not to. they come look over my shoulder and criticize what i'm doing, even if it has nothing to do with any specific processes i was trained on or even if i'm literally actively doing something a certain way that they or other managers have told me to do in the past. an example of the former is that i got critiqued for having sugar packet trash right next to the cup... as i was putting in the last 2 packs of sugar.... and was already planning to throw away all the trash immediately after finishing putting in the sugar. an example of the latter was that i was pulling a bunch of warming tickets (today was busy all day so there were constantly many tickets) after running several items to hand off, and i was trying to see what all bakery i'd need to grab and if there were any doubles of anything so i could warm them at the same time. in the middle of my thinking, i got critiqued for pulling the tickets and was told i should already have things cooking in my machines. this is true. but i swear they've also been a person before to tell me i need to pull tickets otherwise i'm gonna fall behind by not cooking things 2 at a time when i can. this is an example of how i feel like i'm always doing something wrong, even if i know i'm doing what i've been told to do in these super specific situations.

i know it's annoying. i get it. mostly because our mind always first wants to get the tall and you have to switch it. but we also know we will just end up wasting the foam anyways.
the barista at the store told me i had to order the grande if i wanted the extra foam.

the day after i finished my training, another partner (a ss) called and asked me to cover for them from 7:15 to 10:30).. i agreed because i figured a shift super would know if it's okay for me to be covering this early off my training. i come in and my shift is just a wreck. i was on window for about 2 hours but once they switched me to bar (my first time ever) it was so bad. the printer would not stop and there was only one person helping me. i had 30 cups with stickers lined up and ready to go and customers were getting upset. and then....someone orders 2 venti lattes with 6 packets of agave each. so here i am squeezing 13 packets of agave into these damn cups and it hits me. i cannot do this job.
so i texted my manager the next day saying this jon is not for me and i will not be coming back. i said it a lot nicer than that though. should i feel bad for not giving my 2 weeks? i figured it was completely unnecessary seeing as i hadn't even finished my week of ""practice shifts"" and was absolutely not an asset to the team in any way.

3706,0,"tall rant / need some advice i'm a shift and i have a barista partner that i work with frequently (maybe 3/4 of my shifts are with them). we have the closing shift, so it's typically just me and them. they've been one of the main closing baristas basically since they transferred to our store. and they've been at our store for probably 5 months now. they were a partner at another store for a few months before that.
so, at this point, they should really have a grasp on how to do just about everything. we even have a written out closing list. but for some reason... it's like i have to tell them how to close during every close. if they aren't sure what to do, they'll just... kind of pretend??? to wipe the counters???? it's like i'm seeing wiping happening, but i guess it's just too gentle?? almost like they're wiping the counters to look busy instead of doing it to clean them.
the part that i need advice about isn't even really that. it's the fact that this barista... works so slowly. all. the. time. we have several green beans now and they're all essentially lapping this barista. we'll have customers waiting for a single drink for 5 minutes. and this partner won't even use that time to connect with the customers. sometimes i'll work with a barista that doesn't really connect, but it's because they make the drinks so fast that the customer doesn't even notice. but with this barista... the customers just sit there for far too long... waiting for their drink. it's not even just making drinks that takes too long. it's every task.
so, i guess my question is: how do i tell this partner to pick up the damn pace? it does get frustrating for myself and other partners having to feel like we all have to do our own jobs, as well as half of this partner's job. but i'm just not sure how to say, ""go faster.""",1662193704,tall rant need advic shift i a barista partner i work frequent mayb 3 4 shift with have close shift typic and them one of the main close barista basic sinc they transfer store and they ve been our store probabl 5 month they a partner at anoth store for a month that so at point they realli have a grasp to just everyth we even have a written close list for some reason it s like i have to tell them how to close everi close they sure to do they just kind of pretend to wipe the counter it s like i m see wipe happen but i guess it s just gentl almost like they wipe the counter to look busi instead of it to clean them the part that i need advic about t even realli that it s the fact that thi barista work so slowli the time we have sever green bean now and they re all essenti lap thi barista we ll have custom wait for a singl drink for 5 minut and thi partner t even use that time to connect with the custom sometim i ll work with a barista that t realli connect but it s they make the drink so fast that the custom doesn t even notic but with thi barista the custom just sit for far too long wait for drink it s even just make drink that take too long it s everi task so i guess my question how do i tell thi partner to pick the damn pace it get frustrat for and partner to feel like we all have to do our job well as half of thi partner s job but i m just not sure how to say go faster

is every store like this, or is it just my manager?
i'm only asking because if so, i might find a new job. that's ridiculous. i have grandparents that i only see twice a year, one of which is around christmas time.
i love them so much, and with them being older you never know when they're going to go, and i'm not going to miss out on what could be my last holiday with them because i'm stuck making coffee.
i'd also like to add that i looked at the schedules from last year. you know who got time off *christmas week*? my manager. so it's okay for her to spend time with her family, but not anybody else i guess. i didn't know that management made your family time more important than everybody else's?",1662175267,christma season time question and venti rant know littl far away store let request time off holiday month i told today allow make time off request the month novemb decemb and januari i work 5 differ place and not one of place thi at we allow to request off the week of christma is understand but 3 whole month that insan is everi store like thi is manag i ask i might find a new job that s ridicul i grandpar that i onli see twice a year one of which is around christma time i love so much and them older you never know re go to go and i m not go to miss could my last holiday with them becaus i m stuck make coffe i also like to add that i look at the schedul last year you know got time off christma week my manag so it s okay for to spend time with her famili but not anybodi els i guess i t know that manag made your famili time import everybodi els s

moved to a city and went to a starbucks that did 15k+ a day and can only be described as a place where baristas go to lose hope for 6 months before transferring to a cafe. all 7 of the transfers that came while i was there all quit by their third shift.
my distain for the company slowly increasing over the last two years, watching my baristas getting screamed at and my bosses saying there's nothing we can do. watching all the illegal anti union activity that starbucks was doing. my boss promising more hours and eventually going from 30-40 a week to 9 with him saying there's nothing he can do but he's sure it will pick up next quarter( after i go through the majority of my savings of him promising more hours this quarter and scrambling to make rent for three months)
i finally hit a point a week ago where i was reprimanded for being too talkative on register by my boss(outside hire).

3745,0,"the truth about working at starbucks #tobeapartner #unionizestarbucks i quit starbucks yesterday and my mental health immediately improved. this is the tea i was scared to spill and share because i did not want to jeopardize my job. now, i don't care. y'all need to know the truth.
while there was coworkers who i truly enjoyed working with, there were some i truly did not. i will just leave that at that. that's with any place, right? but when the problem people aren't corrected, that's an issue. anyways...
i loved learning about coffee and honing the craft, but quickly it became apparent that starbucks no longer cares about that. they just want to continue making billions off of their dedicated followers and their sugar infused coffee addiction.
while working there, i dealt with some of the worst working conditions i have ever been faced with.
firstly, the fruit fly problem. if you want my advice as a former employee, ask for no fruit pieces in your refreshers. don't get anything with vanilla bean powder, chocolate malt powder, java/frappuccino chips, and matcha. these are all stored in semi-open containers that do not close fully. therefore, fruit flies chill in and on the containers. i had to work the day before we got the pest control treatment for our store and a fruit fly flew up my nose. they were landing all over me. landing in drinks, landing on food. some baristas didn't even throw the drink away they would still hand it out. a fruit fly was found in the cold brew keg before we closed it up and my shift scooped it out and put the lid on to use it still. so, additionally i wouldn't drink the cold brew. i wanted to quit there and then.
secondly, the store i worked at needed a remodel so so badly. it had ceiling tiles missing, our ac would break all the time, and the drain would constantly back up. when i, the only one who spoke up at the store meetings with our district manager, asked about a remodel she said ""other stores would be grateful for what you have."" we were told we were on the list but low on the list for a remodel. two store meetings later the district manager announces two new stores. so they can build new stores that no one asked for but can't improve the already existing stores? awesome!
our ovens literally set the pastries on fire. cookies would light on fire. sandwiches won't cook all the way through. they're still waiting on new ovens. we finally got new espresso machines the beginning of this year. how does a billion dollar company not have the funds to outfit every store with quality equipment?
thirdly, (and this has nothing to do with the company... although, they encourage this ""customization"" culture) the customers are 80% entitled assholes.
even when i worked at olive garden, mcdonald's, cheddars, etc. i never encountered some of these kinds of people. i got cursed out for being out of sugar free vanilla. i got yelled at through the speaker box because i was out of caramel drizzle. i got complained about because this man was yelling at me about how he wanted his latte made i corrected him for being an asshole (respectfully, with much effort). a man once asked me for exactly 16 ice cubes. i was making someone else's drink with the standard scoop of ice and he threw a fit thinking it was his drink. i looked at him dead in the eye and said ""this is not your drink."" his face turned red from embarrassment and he sat his ass down. people complained about their mobile orders never being ready when the truth is, everyone and their momma is sending their order in between 6 am and 10 am so you are gonna have a wait regardless, karen. don't yell at me cause your 4 venti (large) overly sugared and complicated lattes aren't ready. in truth we needed a third espresso machine, but we're lucky to have what we did, remember? camera
fourth, the management. during the time i was there (11 months) there was two store managers. the manager that hired me left two months later. we were without a store manager until about february/march. the man that was a hired (a truly kind man) was an outside hire who was entirely new to starbucks. he lasted 3 or 4 months i think, no offense to him. he did his best trying to make our store better and they ran him off. he left at the beginning of july. we were without a set store manager for the month of august and instead of us getting a new one they pinned our store onto another store manager! she doesn't answer texts, you can only call her. when you did call her you got voicemailed. and if you or what you had to say wasn't considered important? good luck getting a response!
i asked to have a meeting with district manager to discuss all of these issues above, and yet was met with contempt because i was ""supposed"" to reach out to the temporary store manager who had her own store to run and doesn't answer calls. i never fully got to express any of this to anyone but other baristas at work who were also fed up.
i am grateful for the wonderful people i met, but i implore you, if you've read this far, to go to a local coffee shop. the whole company needs to unionize. there is no reason our store should be as dilapidated as it is when we're one of the top earning stores. sbux ceo can get a billion dollar bonus, and we can't get new machines.
there is way way more i could share, but i close with this:
grateful to have learned what i did, met who i did. it was a complete learning experience. i'm just all in all disappointed. i wanted to work there since i was 16 years old. sad that my expectations weren't met by this forbes listed company to work for. sad that they run off everyone who actually cares and wants to make the stores a better place.",1662167822,truth work tobeapartn unionizestarbuck

3760,0,"don't ever ask for washroom at starbucks! i stopped by ny starbucks location to grab a cup of coffee although there were other cafes nearby cuz i knew this one had a restroom i could use. while there was a wait in line, i asked one of the employees for the washroom passcode and i would like to inform you of the terrible experience you could get from this store.
when i politely asked for the passcode, she/he replied there is no such thing as a restroom in this store.
so i pointed to the place where all the people were using it, and then he/she replied "" oh there was one? i did not know that"" with a very sarcastic tone.
i asked him/her again politely (ex. could you ask your co-worker) since that denial attitude was appearing to be intentional, and he/she was clearly rejecting to respond to my question. she/he even said the restroom passcode is posted on the wall. (meaning she knew we were talking about the washroom. so of course, i replied, there is not. then he said, ""then i don't know lol lol ?""
the employee's attitude was distinctly rude and intentionally denied to tell to the specific person. i found this extremely disrespectful and i truly felt that was racial discrimination.
i understand that everyone has a tough day, but this situation like asking for a passcode would not possibly make any employee upset.
after that, i shared this conversation with the employee who's in charge of the store at the moment,
as soon as i approached to her, she suddenly ran into me and finally informed me the toilet code and apologized that she thought i was asking for wifi password since wifi and washroom sound the same. looool.

3839,0,"(rant) school is clashing with job **tl;dr at end**
i'm here to rant because this particularly involves my current (and new - since mid early august) job at starbucks. so, to first provide my context, i stopped working at a restaurant job (that i was fairly new in late april-early june this year) to pursue my professional certificate in cybersecurity. i had stopped working for about 2 months because i passed this certification after 2 months of hardcore studying (woo!). i decided to quit the restaurant job that i was working at because i never really liked the workplace anyways and it wasn't my cup of tea when it comes to working in the service industry. management also sucked too.
fast forward, i'm now hired at starbucks and currently working as a new employee when school starts. since i had switched my majors, it's taking a bit longer for me to finish my degree so i decided that it was in my best interest to do an extra load of classes. these **online** classes were already accelerated enough but instead of the standard full load of 5 classes, i did 6. (these classes are a quarter long, btw. 8 weeks each and there's the first 8 weeks of the semester \[first session\] then the 2nd 8 weeks of the semester \[2nd session\] so the classes are divided by 2). i had already planned this out before i got my job at starbucks and now that school has started, i'm starting to realize the consequences of having a physically tiring job with an overload of school work. though i only have 3 classes, all of them are expecting of all students to do continuous studying and engagement, combined with labs, projects, and tests.
throughout this whole ordeal i also found out that i needed to pay for my own tuition for this upcoming winter semester and i'm about $5000 short so i'm trying to earn as much as i can so my parents don't have to pay as much and we can split the money. so me working is definitely a necessity.
i guess the best way to sum up my problem is that my (somewhat) physically and mentally (sometimes) taxing job at starbucks is not mixing well with the extra load of class that i'm taking. it's already hard enough to find time to go to the gym and enjoy my own time but it seems like i'm either working, studying, eating (while working and studying), or sleeping. while i know that the most common solution right now would be to lower my hours, i don't think that lowering hours would help my case since i still need to earn enough to where i can afford to pay for most of my tuition next semester.
i've been thinking about a job that's remote and something along the lines of customer service. which not only makes it easier for me to manage my time with classes but also just to get out of the food/beverage industry. i've been working in the this industry since 2019 and needless to say, i'm quite exhausted from all the physical hard work and mental stress when it comes to dealing with hangry customers.
**tl;dr** \- i'm stuck at a wall. i hate to leave my new coworkers because everyone is so nice and i hate the idea of job hopping but i'm also realizing that the physical and mental demand of starbucks is not mixing well with the stress of my classes but i'm forced to work due to tuition so i really dont know what to do",1662093775,rant school clash job tl dr end rant particularli involv current new sinc mid earli august job at to first provid my context i stop work at restaur job i fairli new late april earli june thi year to pursu my profession certif in cybersecur i stop work 2 month becaus i pass thi certif 2 month hardcor studi woo i decid to quit restaur job that i wa work at becaus i never realli like the workplac anyway and my cup of tea it come to work in the servic industri manag also suck fast forward i m hire at starbuck and current work a new employe when school start sinc i had switch my major it take a bit longer for to finish my degre so i decid that it wa in my best interest to extra load of class onlin class alreadi acceler enough instead of the standard full load of 5 class i 6 these class a quarter long btw 8 week and s the first 8 week of the semest first session the 2nd 8 week of the semest 2nd session so the class are divid 2 i had alreadi plan thi i got my job at starbuck and now that school start i m start to realiz the consequ of a physic tire job with an overload of school work though i 3 class of are expect of all student to do continu studi and engag combin with lab project and test throughout thi whole ordeal i also found out that i need to pay for my tuition for thi upcom winter semest and i m about 5000 short so i m tri to earn as much as i so my parent t have to pay as much and can split the money so me work is definit a necess i guess the best way to sum my problem is that my somewhat physic and mental sometim tax job at starbuck is mix well with the extra load of class that i m take it s alreadi hard enough to find time to go to the gym and enjoy my own time but it seem like i m either work studi eat work and studi sleep while i know that the common solut right now would to lower my hour i don t think that lower hour would help my case sinc i still need to earn enough to i can afford to pay for most of my tuition next semest i think about a job that s remot and someth along the line of custom servic not onli make it easier for me to manag my time with class but also to get out of the food beverag industri i ve been work in the thi industri sinc 2019 and needless to say i m quit exhaust all the physic hard work and mental stress when it come to deal with hangri custom tl dr i m stuck at a wall i hate to leav my new cowork becaus everyon is so nice and i hate the idea of job hop but i m also realiz that the physic and mental demand of starbuck is not mix well with the stress of my class but i m forc to work due to tuition so i realli dont know to do

1) several years ago the cups or lids changed, and lids became much less secure. coffee drips out no matter what - yes, the seam is opposite the lid opening. i've had some baristas and managers agree that something obviously changed, but they were never able to explain. our collective hunch is that corporate changed suppliers.
2) store volume. music has been turned up to a much higher volume in the last year or so, and on top of that, the staff seems to be in a competition for who can make the most noise. slamming things around, dropping things then laughing wildly, yelling at each other despite having headsets, and shoving that ice door so hard it could possibly launch into the parking lot. i'm in upstate south carolina but have noticed this in plenty of stores nationwide. it used to be a semi-quiet place to get stuff done while enjoying friendly baristas and good music. it's bordering on a loud dive bar at this point.

3909,0,"ssv faced with loa or a wrongful write up. issues with getting disability pay. can anyone help me? kinda long but please read anyway!
i'm sure we've all noticed the bs starbucks is putting us lesser paid employees through so please read my situation and any advice or help would be great.
i've been working for starbucks for almost 5 years. i've always tolerated it for the pay and my lovely coworkers. (there's not much high paying jobs where i'm from in texas, but trust me.. starting last week, i've applied to almost 25 different jobs)
around 8/17 my asm, sm, and dm had a sit down conversation with me at the beginning of my shift to discuss others partners concerns of my mental health and well-being. i agreed that i have not been doing okay, but it's not any of my managers business especially if i still do my job correctly. they showed me a log of my clock-ins and outs and tried to tell me they can write me up for me being one minute late two days in a row. they also tried to tell me another ssv remembers me pulling a no call, no show which is completely false. i remember specifically calling in sick that day... which i have every right to do. now, me being late by 60 seconds is because of the covid check ins we have to do. 60 seconds. i understand policies are policies but are you kidding me?
anyway, i was essentially faced with either taking a 4 week loa and that i can file for disability through sedgwick to get paid for my leave. or i can take the write up and continue with work and just take the day off. knowing i am grounds for demotion after this second write up (if i accepted and signed it/didn't take the medical loa) i feel like this is completely messed up. but it's okay because they're offering/reassuring me that i will still get paid... so i thought.
i had immediately contacted sedgwick for a case and all that to see what was needed to get me paid with the loa hours i earned. sedgwick is now not paying me anything for disability considering that they need my psychiatrist's say so on documented paper for 4 weeks off of work.
this wasn't my psychiatrist's idea, it was my managers. i can't ask my psychiatrist for something he didn't even do.
2 weeks later, i am now completely broke, lost my brand new apartment that i can't even afford to break lease at. i'm back at my moms where i'm not necessarily welcome. i feel completely screwed over by starbucks. i feel like i'm purposely being thrown out of work for something that i didn't deserve.
i already tried the cup fund for a place to live but my manager had denied it. i tried calling sedgwick but i've gotten hung up on twice by accident i'm assuming and now i'm trying my best with pcc.
if anyone can help me do something about this, i would love the input.

3932,0,"venti rant i am so tired so for some background, i work at a pretty high volume drive thru/cafe store, i've been a barista for about 4 months or so now and the day i was hired was also my sm's first day, so naturally it's been a bit of a transition for the whole store. not to mention with school starting we just lost half of our staff, we just outside hired a bunch of shifts that are having to learn barista and shift duties and everyone is worn completely thin. also! there's always something broken or that we're out of and the time it takes to get it fixed only for it to break again or run out again within hours is insane!!! i'm absolutely sure this is not a problem specific to my store but moving on
as we all know, pumpkin spice season started 2 days ago. so naturally, we've been pretty damn busy. we still have the old mastrenas at my store, so we pull blonde from the drive bar hopper and decaf from the cafe bar one. the entire drive thru mastrena broke the day before pumpkin madness started, so we can't pull any blonde shots and we're down to one machine for cafe/drive/mobile. cool, we can manage, just have to be careful what order we're pulling tickets and making drinks since there's only one machine that can pull shots. today, decaf went down which is really great considering it is the only thing besides like herbal tea and milk that doesn't have caffeine in it :,) oh yeah and our nitro machine works probably 2 days out of the month, to the point our sm has started consistently telling people in drive thru who try to order it ""it's like the mcdonald's ice cream machine, it's never up and running haha lol""
we have no blonde espresso, no decaf espresso, no nitro, the poor baristas who end up on hot bar are dripping sweat and nearly in tears trying to keep times down and make drinks right on the one working machine and cold bar is running around trying to do all they can to support hot bar and keep up with their drinks too, all while we have people legitimately shrieking about pumpkin spice over the headset in drive thru. the ticket was put in for the blonde bar multiple days ago now, and lord knows how long it's gonna take for them to come fix it. i'm just waiting to hear that our other mastrena bit the dust and we have no espresso bar whatsoever lmao.
i just feel like the team we have is so strong, the majority of our tools and supplies are just either broken or missing completely, and we aren't ever able to actually be set up for success due to the lack of actual tools we need to be successful to the standards they want from us
this was longer and significantly harder to follow than i meant for it to be, but that is also how every single shift i've worked for the past week has been so it's fitting

the first 3 minutes i sat on the table studying, this one barista said ""hey you"" and i'm like ""me?"" she asked if i wanted this free frappe and we had a brief convo about it. i found that little interaction cute so after studying i'm like ""maybe i'll get another free frappe again if i come back"" jk i just like talking to people.
so i went back again the next day, she asked how the frappe was, another brief convo. but that was it. i kept going everyday (i'm a 2 week regular now) she always hi to me and asks how i'm doing everyday then she started serving the drinks (the tables are kinda far off from the counter) to me that i got mixed signals if she was flirting or just being really nice.
so i asked my other barista friend if this girl was flirting and she said yes. so that made me make scenarios in my head on how would i make my move to try to get close to her that i ended up being shy when i get to the cafe and seeing her that i acted cold and didnt even greet her. then i realized i had a big crush on this barista.
after that, she was off for a couple of days and then when i finally saw her again, i did the same thing and acted cold. for the whole time i was there studying i wanted to talk to her but she was working and i'm shy like an anime school girl,
i finally snapped and made a scuffed letter from scratch
i spent the entirety of my stay working on it but in the end it was still so bad but i saw her with her bag about to leave that i had to rush my letter and i basically asked her out in it, when i saw her leave i ran to her, couldn't find my words i just said ""hey"" covering my face with my arm because i was blushing too much. gave it to her and i ran away.
after that i have not seen her for the past 3 days so i'm thinking maybe she quit because that interaction was the cringes thing she's seen all week. am. i just overthinking or she hates me loudly_crying_face
tl;dr. barista was really nice to me that she became my crush. 1 or 2 weeks later, i gave her a letter saying ""ur really interesting, let's go out"". i have not seen her for 3 or 4 days ever since that

4028,0,"an open letter to baristas dear baristas,
i am a long-long-longtime customer of starbucks. i pick up coffee every morning on my way to work. at this point, i haven't missed a day in over two years. sometimes i use the drive thru, but mostly i place my order on the app and run inside to pick it up.
what i am met with, each and every day from the baristas is a smile and a warm hello. yes, i'm a regular, so they all know me at this point. but i see them do it to everyone. whether or not you're asked by management to do this is beside the point. it's genuine, and i can tell.
to all baristas: thank you. i'm convinced you don't hear that enough.
morning is an interesting time of day. when you see your customers, their day has either gotten off to a good start, or a bad one. too often you're on the front lines of someone fighting a bad day. they make you the face of their problems and lash out, nearly always, for no reason. i've seen it happen.
i can't think of a place that requires multitasking more than starbucks. i watch you. i'm in awe of you, honestly. you are taking endless orders, all customized, while handling cash transactions and listening to gripes from customers. and the karens. there are so many karens.
the teamwork you display on a minute-to-minute basis is inspiring. as a hiring manager of my own firm, seeing starbucks barista on a resume will always get my attention. you are such a talented and hardworking group. you may argue that there are exceptions, and surely, anytime you employ as many as you do, there will be exceptions. but they are so few and far between. they are not who i'm talking to. i'm talking to you. thank you.
your coffee literally makes my day better. even when there's not enough cream. or too much cream. or it's not hot enough. whatever. it's coffee. the world will not begin or end with my coffee.
but i know my day will begin with a smile from my barista. and for that, i am grateful.",1661970534,open letter barista dear barista long long longtim custom i pick coffe everi morn way to work point i miss a day two year sometim i use drive thru mostli i place my order on the app run insid to pick up i am met and everi day the barista a smile and a warm hello ye i a regular know at thi point but i see it to everyon whether ask manag to do thi is besid the point it genuin and i tell to all barista thank you i m convinc you t hear enough morn is an interest time of day you see custom day either gotten to a good start or a bad one often you re on the front line of someon fight a bad day they make you the face of their problem and lash nearli alway reason i seen it happen i can t think of a place that requir multitask starbuck i watch you i m in awe of you honestli you take endless order all custom handl cash transact and listen to gripe from custom and the karen are so mani karen the teamwork you display on a minut to minut basi is inspir a hire manag of my firm see starbuck barista on a resum alway get my attent you are a talent and hardwork group you may argu that there are except and sure anytim you employ as mani as you do there will except but they are so and far they are not i m talk to i m talk to you thank you your coffe liter make my day better even when there s not enough cream or too much cream or it s not hot enough whatev it s coffe the world will not begin or end with my coffe but i know my day will begin with a smile from my barista and for that i am grate

5. how long should i spend answering each question? 20 seconds or 2 minutes? do they time me of some sort or just tell me when to stop?
6. what are the types of questions they ask? i'm curious about this because i'm not so sure whether or not they'll ask me about the history (founded when or where, all founders, dates, etc.) or menu items (like memorizing the entire menu or some parts of it beforehand)?????? lots of different web pages, quizlets, youtubers all have different answers to this one too......

this has blindsided many partners. this works out to be about one semester covered, if even that. if you are someone who is unable to get grants and scholarships because of your parents income then you are screwed. if you are considering working at starbucks to go to asu you need to be really careful about how your tuition is being covered.

4102,0,"starbucks was easily the worst job i ever had. man. i still think about my job at starbucks and how much of a nightmare it all was. basically, i had just graduated from college with a bachelor's of science degree. i applied for several jobs in my field, but was often shot down for not having enough experience. so i decided to just apply to starbucks thinking it might hold me over until i find something more legitimate. i ended up getting hired.
but man. there i was, getting paid next to nothing, getting bossed around all day by high school students, being stuck with the filthiest jobs nobody else wanted to do. i was educated with a legit science degree, probably more educated than most people there if not everyone, but everybody treated me like i was just the stuuuuupidest idiot in the whole store. they gave me barely any training at all, and then would get pissed at me or treat me like i was just an idiot if i had a question or didn't know how to do something. anything that ever went wrong, even things that i had absolutely nothing to do with, i would get blamed for. someone put a cafe order on the mobile order stand? i must have done it. drive thru line moving too slowly? it couldn't be the baristas in charge of making the drinks....it had to be the *stupid idiot* handing them out. i swear when working dtr or dto, i was constantly berated over the drive thru times, even though it was obviously the baristas who were taking too long to make the drinks. just because i happen to be working dto, doesn't mean i have control over the drive thru times.
i was also micromanaged to hell. any slight thing i did differently, was the wrong way to do it. if i ran a customer's card before handing them the drink, i was berated for it. my manager would constantly be standing over my shoulder, talking to me like i was a 4 year old child explaining how to run the credit card and hand them the drink. no customer ever once complained about me running their payment before handing their drink. they didn't even notice, it didn't even delay them whatsoever beyond like a second or two. if anything, they would get confused by me handing them the drink as they were handing me the card, like this awkward fumble. and then the one time i do it my manager's way, the customer's payment gets declined after i hand them the drink. of course she wasn't around to see it, so i probably got blamed for that too. i also remember one time when it got slow and nothing was going on, so i went into the back room to take a drink of water for like 30 seconds. at which point, i was literally berated for taking a tiny break and drinking water.
nobody ever trusted me to work on bar. i would often get *trained* to work on bar, but then the next day i'd just be stuck on dto or cleaning the bathrooms or some shit and never worked on bar again. i would have loved to make the drinks, like whenever i did it it was actually fun for me, and i felt like i was doing something important for once. but i was considered too stupid to ever do it. for the 6 months i worked there, i probably worked on bar for a total of 2 minutes.
eventually i just got so fed up. i remember one time someone who i went to high school with came in, driving a nice bmw and wearing nice clothes, clearly successful. and there i was with my little stupid green apron and hat. so embarrassing lol. i just couldn't handle thinking about what bullshit was in store for me the next day. i started showing up late, but i'd still do my job the best i could. ended up putting in my two weeks notice, but my manager fired me literally the day before my last day, just one last ""fuck you"".

to my understanding, only coffee beans were counted as 7 days, but you count the day you open it as day 1, so the day dot is gonna be the 6th day, with the understanding that it expires at the end of the day on that 6th day. so i'm not entirely sure and i would just like clarification on standards, plus an explanation please!

i've inquired about open positions at some of the local stores within 5 miles of were i live (there are 4 stores) and the store managers have told me that starbucks has never offered seasonal positions for employees and that starbucks recently implemented a minimum amount of required hours worked by partners of 12 hours per week, and a minimum of 17 hours of posted availability. i was very disappointed to learn this. i could very easily give probably 20 hours of availability, but since i am in my career, i don't know that i could guarentee 12 hours every week. i was hoping to be an option as needed in peek seasons, like now through the holidays, or even in the summer months in the afternoons.
with the state of how our economy is now, with places frequently being understaffed, why would starbucks limit their resources for individuals that would like to devote their spare time? what about teachers during the summer and weekend side gigs? any advice friends? i honestly think i'm outta luck but didn't know if anyone else has experienced this.",1661894029,look part time gig a local roadblock hi a former starbuck barista 6 year experi i work at a store downtown part citi the way colleg 2013 2019 flash forward today i am work a busi analyst project manag for my local govern depart i love my career enjoy i i crave work at a starbuck honestli sinc i left i genuin miss a barista much i inquir open posit at of the local store within 5 mile of i live 4 store and the store manag have told starbuck never offer season posit for employe and that starbuck recent implement a minimum amount of requir hour work partner of 12 hour per week and a minimum of 17 hour of post avail i veri disappoint to learn i could veri easili give probabl 20 hour of avail but sinc i am in my career i know that i could guarente 12 hour everi week i wa hope to option as need in peek season like through the holiday even in the summer month in the afternoon with the state of economi now with place frequent be understaf would starbuck limit resourc for individu that would like to devot their spare time what about teacher the summer and weekend side gig advic friend i honestli think i outta luck but t know anyon els ha experienc thi

me: with water or lemonade?
customer: make it with whatever it usually comes with
me: it can come with either one
customer: lemonade then
just a tip to customers. whenever you order always order with the size first and if it's hot or iced.
good example: i would like a venti iced caramel macchiato
bad example: i would like a caramel macchiato
you can even say small, medium, or large, we know what you mean. do not say ""regular size"".

baristas aren't technically allowed to offer straws for drinks that do not require one as our cups are literally meant to be used without a straw.
it's very frustrating when i'm doing solo dt and a customer is waiting on their drink and waits for me to hand it to them to ask for a straw. i am already slower as i'm solo but it slows me down even more when people do that. on top of that, just ask for everything you want. don't wait for me to come back with your cream to ask for another thing and then rinse repeat.

4256,0,"tips for new and incoming baristas tomorrow is my last day and all of these are purely based off of my 2 years here.
1. absorb as much as you can from your training and never be afraid to ask for help.
2. try out other brands of espresso, starbucks isn't that good tbh.
3. its not a bad thing if you're not always on bar. others need a turn and you might just aide your team better somewhere else.
4. we are a team. not everyone gets along but try to support your team as much as you can. it makes for an easier shift.
5. be kind to your openers, odds are they have the highest traffic hours. this is a coffee shop.
6. your closers want to know what you need to open. they don't need to know every little thing that was wrong.
7. if you're opening, fully prep and stock everything you can think of. it can turn your whole shift around.
8. do not live and die for this job. it can be fun but its a job. your joints and bones are not worth the wear and tear.
9. if you're a high schooler be respectful of your full time partners. this job is their livelihood and not always a fun place for you to chitchat and play around in.
10. stores that gossip all the time are not worth the hassle.
11. grow a thick skin. the things customers say and do to us can be vile and rude. i promise holding on to any of it will hurt more than you need.
12. find your regulars, these customers will be the best you have ever known and are more than worth the trouble of others.
13. unionize. your managers are more often than not, not a good source of information about unions and cooperate does not care about us
14. do not be afraid to speak up against your shifts to your manager if something wrong is happening. your concerns deserve to be heard
15. enjoy it. starbucks is a rush like no other.
have fun everyone. it was nice knowing and making coffee with all of you. please try not to make any new osha violations.",1661820335,tip new incom barista tomorrow last day and pure base of my 2 year 1 absorb much as train and never afraid ask for help 2 tri brand of espresso good tbh 3 bad thing you not alway bar other need a turn and you might aid your team better somewher els 4 are a team not everyon get along tri to support your team as much as you can make for easier shift 5 be kind to your open odd are highest traffic hour is a coffe shop 6 your closer want to know you need to open they t need to know everi littl thing that wrong 7 if you re open fulli prep and stock everyth you can think of it can turn your whole shift around 8 not live and die for thi job it can be fun but it a job your joint and bone are not worth the wear and tear 9 if you re a high schooler be respect of your full time partner thi job is livelihood and not alway a fun place for you to chitchat and play around 10 store that gossip all the time are not worth the hassl 11 grow a thick skin the thing custom say and do to us can be vile and rude promis hold on to of it hurt you need 12 find your regular these custom will be the best you have ever known and are more than worth the troubl of other 13 union your manag are more often than not not a good sourc of inform union and cooper not care about us 14 do not be afraid to speak your shift to your manag if someth wrong is happen your concern deserv to be heard 15 enjoy it starbuck is a rush like other have fun everyon it wa nice know and make coffe all of you pleas tri not to make ani new osha violat

"" and he yells"" no! the same drink but in a tall!"" so making sure i wasn't getting anything wrong i ask ""you want two? one in a venti one in a tall?"" he screams yes and drives off too the window.
admittedly it was only two partners on the floor and we ran out of vsc for his vscc so after i make the vsc i go to the window and tell him his total. he just looks at me with his phone and says nothing. i ask him ""apple pay? "" and he says yes so i hand the card reader out the window and he asks me ""do i insert my phone before or after?"" and confused say "" insert your phone? for what"" he responds like a smart ass "" for the points! what are you slow or something?""
at that point i close the window in his face and turned around to ask someone else to handle it.

4297,0,"shaken espresso with no ice struggle the good ol' shaken espresso with no ice bullshit. we have a new regular who has been ordering this drink. venti shaken espresso, no ice, no classic, with almond milk. naturally when i arrived at this drink while bar supporting i told the baristas to let me know when this person showed up so i could explain that this drink isn't meant to be made this way. the baristas informed me that this regular is deaf and they have a hard time communicating with them so all of them have just been making a venti iced quad latte with no ice, essentially.
today i got the mobile order again so i wrote on the cup ""this needs to be ordered as a latte, thanks."" i genuinely am not trying to be rude, i just want them to get what they want and understand that a shaken espresso is not what they are actually ordering. i'm not sure what will happen next or if they even noticed the note however i'm not going to give someone special treatment just because they are deaf/hard of hearing. actually i find it quite rude when someone acts entitled because of a disability. i try extremely hard to treat everyone the same, equally, no matter who they are or how i feel about them (if i know them well). everyone deserves to be treated fairly. i feel as though it is not fair to give this one person a pass just because they aren't willing to try and communicate with us.
that being said, i'm not sure if anyone has ever actually explained to them that this drink cannot be shaken and *is,* in fact, an iced latte. i guess we'll see. i have not checked the price difference on a venti shaken espresso vs a venti iced quad latte. i don't know what the correct way to go about this is, i'm just hoping maybe next time i can actually talk with her somehow to help clarify what these drinks are so that she can order exactly what she wants.

recent post about sugar addiction made me look up the sugar for my favorite drink-venti chai frappucino and while i get it with soy and no whip, i would bet that it's still pretty close to the 57 g of sugar posted for the standard recipe. i then looked up the iced chai latter and it's even more sugar at 61g for the venti. i get the chai frap 3-4x/wk fyi
can someone explain how that works? someone else kindly answered in another post that sugar is pre-added to the chai mix which explains a lot. is there another syrup added or is the ""chai mix"" just chai and sugar?
any suggestions on less sugary drinks i would like based on my taste preferences?
i like chai, cinnamon, caramel, mocha, espresso (?), cold drinks preferred

4318,0,"a venti rant about a condescending shift supervisor i work mornings at 4am and constantly i'm placed in the drive-through, doing both dto and dtr. i liked it in the beginning, but the morning shifts put me there all the time and it's burnt me out too many times--no one at my store likes the drive-through and it's only green beans who are placed there.
i was placed on dto/dtr today and noticed that the times were unusually high--i checked and saw that i was waiting on a few food items for the car at the window. everyone was occupied and i asked a few times on headset if the food was ready, but i didn't get a response. so i left my area at the drive-thru and walked to warming, which one of my coworkers who is a shift supervisor (but wasn't the ""keyholder"" at the time, if that makes sense) immediately yelled at me in front of my other coworkers, saying ""can't you just wait at your position. do you know you're not supposed to leave? you're really stressing me out"", and immediately i apologized because it wasn't my intention.
i don't know but i feel humiliated in some way. previously there were multiple times where her coaching seemed a bit pretentious. she'd start her comments with ""can you please \[...\]"" or ""you're supposed to know this/that"". i accepted it in the beginning because i was a new barista, but i just can't do this anymore :/ i also don't really know if this is because of starbucks policy or something, but none of the shifts at my store ever work at the drive-thru, they're either on front or customer support.
i'm always placed at the drive-thru. i'm really starting to despise it, i've asked if i can be switched, and my morning shifts say that it's my only option--that i can do dtr/dto, or both. i'd work in the afternoon since the closing shifts are way more laidback, but i can't because of school. i'm really thinking about putting in my two weeks because honestly this is my last straw ://",1661788216,venti rant a condescend shift supervisor work morn 4am constantli i place drive dto and dtr i like in the begin the morn shift put the time and it burnt me mani time one at store like the drive through and it s green bean place there i place dto dtr today and notic the time unusu high i check and saw that i wa wait on a food item the car at the window everyon wa occupi and i ask a few time on headset the food wa readi but i get a respons i left my area at the drive thru and walk warm one my cowork who a shift supervisor but t the keyhold at the time if that make sens immedi yell at me in front of my cowork say t wait at posit you know you suppos to leav you re realli stress me out and immedi i apolog it wasn t my intent i t know but i feel humili in way previous there were multipl time coach seem a bit pretenti start her comment can you pleas you re suppos to know that i accept it in the begin becaus i wa a new barista but i just can t do thi anymor i also don t realli know if thi is becaus of polici or someth but none of the shift at my store ever work at the drive thru re either on front or custom support i m alway place at the drive thru i m realli start to despis it i ask if i can switch and my morn shift say that it s my onli option that i can do dtr dto or both i d work in the afternoon sinc the close shift are way laidback but i can t becaus of school i m realli think about put in my two week becaus honestli thi is my last straw

so i used to work at the starbucks in bullseye and i moved out from it. while i was there, there were no rules against any kind against makeup or hair colour. you could wear lipstick, eyeliner, you could have funky hair, etc.
one of my friends just started working there with their partner, and they just dyed their hair pink and were told it's not allowed for sbux employees and they had to dye it a natural colour. their partner also told me that they weren't allowed to wear any kind of makeup except eyeliner, no lipstick or anything.
is this a new thing, or is this just the bullseye management giving them false info? because they weren't told by the manager for the sbux, they were told by a manager of bullseye.
i feel like saying ""no lipstick"" is really a tad too far for limits on presentation. nail polish? sure. it chips. hair colour? weird, because i don't think anyone's sweating hard enough for the dye to drip into food. lipstick? how is that a food safety hazard?? even if they're all masked (which isn't required for them anymore but they still mask up) they still can't wear it. it baffles me.",1661787467,question peopl work appli main starbuck the starbuck store ie bullsey kiosk in mall etc use to work at the starbuck in bullsey i move i there rule ani kind against makeup or hair colour could wear lipstick eyelin you could funki hair etc one of friend start work there partner and just dy their hair pink and were told it allow for sbux employe and they to dye it natur colour their partner also told they allow to wear ani kind of makeup except eyelin no lipstick or anyth thi a new thing or is thi just the bullsey manag give fals info they weren t told the manag for the sbux they were told by a manag of bullsey i feel like say no lipstick is realli a tad far for limit present nail polish sure it chip hair colour weird becaus i t think anyon s sweat hard enough for the dye to drip food lipstick is that a food safeti hazard even they mask t requir for them anymor they still mask they still can t wear it it baffl me

anyways, i really loved training him and i realized i miss training newbies. i've trained like 7 green beans and i almost always love the experience i have with them. 2 of my trainees have become shift supervisors and pretty quickly too. and i'm super proud of both of them. one of them was a gifted almighty natural and took to everything so quick. the other struggled and i coached her and continued to coach her and she got better and better and better. and she always told me what a great teacher i was. she is such a ray of light and i know some of her past and getting that promotion i know meant a lot to her. also, i have to say i love being on more of my own schedule when i'm training. it feels nice to have more control of your time at work.
anyways now that i'm a shift i know its super rare to have me train new hires. and honestly, the experience i had training a shift this week was really great. i would love to train more people becoming shift supervisors. like i'm thinking the same way the barista trainer system works where we follow along a training plan and the modules and shit. but all i know of is my own experience where my store manager trained me.",1661756404,shift trainer store manag thing hi yall curiou there a thing a shift trainer like barista trainer shift supervisor i wa train for posit my store manag hire a brand new shift sinc i there we ve just peopl transfer had prior experi as a shift i wa just wonder if store manag train barista becom shift or if s possibl for a shift supervisor to train peopl to becom shift supervisor i ask we just had new shift transfer in and onli had a littl experi as a shift but train alreadi but my manag had run a bunch shift to train him but it wa just me like free wheel it base i know to job it t like i wa use modul or anyth and like i said he had done the train so he knew like how cash manag and stuff work but i wa explain like to do thing and like the flow of the store anyway i realli love train him and i realiz i miss train newbi i ve train like 7 green bean and i almost alway love the experi i with 2 of my traine have becom shift supervisor and pretti quickli and i super proud of of them one of them wa a gift almighti natur and took to everyth so quick the struggl and i coach and continu to coach her and got better and better and better and she alway told me what a great teacher i wa she is such a ray of light and i know some of her past and get that promot i know meant a lot to her also i have to say i love on more of my schedul when i m train it feel nice to have more control of time work anyway that i m a shift i know super rare to have me train new hire and honestli the experi i had train a shift thi week wa realli great i would love to train more peopl becom shift supervisor like i m think the way the barista trainer system work we follow along a train plan and the modul and shit but all i know of is my own experi where my store manag train me

i interviewed for starbucks and during my interview i was asked if i would be willing to be at other stores in the same city. i said yes because there was no particular reason for me to only work at that specific store. so turns out they were sending me to train at a store as a new one was opening up. at the store i was training at, i made such good friendships with the partners there in a matter of a few days. they're all very good at working together and very good with each other aside from work as well. sadly i had to leave them as soon as the new store opened and i hoped it was for the best. unfortunately, they turned out to no be very nice people. they're not very good at communicating for work and teamworking. they spend the time they have in between peaks talking instead of stocking things, cleaning up, chechick ice, etc. (which they could honestly do while talking since they're using headsets anyways) but honestly i think this mostly bothers me because they usually leave me out and when i do try to talk and start conversations i'm shut out. i've never had a bad interaction with them or anything, but they've just known each other before and maybe that's why. that's why transferring back came up, but idk what to tell my manager cuz i cant just tell her they don't include me lol (and if i do they'd prolly deny it either way) but yeah idk what to tell her. in addition to all that i've inly been at the new store for a few weeks. would i need to be there for a certain amount of time before transferring or no. also, the store i wanna transfer to is further from the one im at now, so i cant use commute as an excuse. plz lmk your guys opinions on what i should do. im honestly so confusedloudly_crying_face",1661746985,vent rant need u guy tell to doo ok i interview interview i ask i would will to be store citi i said ye wa particular reason for me to work at specif store so turn send me to train at store a new one wa open at the store i wa train at i made good friendship the partner there in a matter a day they good at work togeth and veri good with other asid work as well sadli i to leav as soon as the new store open and i hope wa for the best unfortun they turn out to no be veri nice peopl they re veri good at commun for work and teamwork they spend the time they in peak talk instead of stock thing clean up chechick ice etc they could honestli talk sinc they re use headset anyway honestli i think mostli bother me becaus they usual leav me out and i do tri to talk and start convers i shut out i never had a bad interact with them anyth but they ve known each other and mayb that that s whi transfer back came up but idk what to tell my manag cuz i cant just tell they includ me lol and if i do they prolli deni it either way but yeah idk what to tell her in addit to all that i ve inli at the new store for a few week would i need to be there for a certain amount of time befor transfer or no also the store i wanna transfer to from the one im at so i cant use commut as excus plz lmk guy opinion what i do im honestli so confusedloudly_crying_fac

4388,0,"there is life outside of starbucks. former partner here. i was employed in 2016, promoted in late 2018 until i was separated as a ssv in 2020 without probable cause (hr is no help), returned in 2021 as a barista thinking i could start all over and quit the same year because i realized this life is behind me now. i put off my education because i was so invested in moving up the latter. i only hung out with coworkers and i constantly thought and spoke about starbucks in social settings. my friends that didn't work for the company found it very annoying.
one year later, i am a different person. i have a 4.0 gpa in college, employed at a local coffee shop making more tips and better hours, and more importantly, my relationship with my close friends that never worked for the bux improved immensely. there are times where i do miss working for the company and the few good customers that made it a positive experience, but i remind myself of how horrible of a time it was while working there.
my current job, we are required to sign an nda to prevent any sort of workplace hostility such as gossiping about coworkers. i cannot tell you how fantastic it is that i work with people that do not form cliques, talk about each other, and support each other regardless of their skill set on the job. we know we signed a contract and we can get fired if we spoke badly about one another, but it subconsciously influenced us to see the good in each other instead of finding a trait that bothers us towards each other. having a positive work environment without any animosity truly does improve your well-being and mentality overall.
to all the baristas out there, you are all doing a great job. i understand that most people who move up do not deserve to be in the positions they're in, but try to overcome it and prevent engaging in any sort of negative interactions with other baristas, ssvs, sms and even dms. we all hate the cliques, gossiping, the unsupportive behavior, nepotism, favoritism and horrible customers, but remember you are wonderful as a person. don't let starbucks consume you and make it your personality, it will hold you back and possibly fall into a depression like i did. go in, do your job, and go home. north star? third place? customer connection? do the bare minimum. the company can care less about you and replace you in an instant, so as i said, don't let it become you. if you need the job, then stay. if you want to move up, that is also good too, just remember who you are deep down inside. life outside of starbucks is great. i am a lot happier leaving behind the toxicity that was prevalent within the company. you don't have to be like me and leave to be happy, but i'm just sharing my experience. if you have great partners, a store manager, and district manager, consider yourself lucky because i see that as a rare occurance, cherish it. nevertheless, do what makes you happy regardless.

okay, then food markouts. we get seven food markouts a week. i usually only work four days a week. i've worked three days this week and go in tomorrow, sunday. like i said i usually only get a sandwich or other food item everytime i work. that's three food markouts i've used this week. i should have four left. does that mean tomorrow i can go home with four free food items? and how do i do that? i've bought more than one food item before and when i select ""partner food"", it only applies it to one item then charges me discount price for the other items. on the pos, do i have select each item in the order and apply partner food? or do i have to do separate transactions for each item and apply partner food on each transaction?
last question (i know i've gone on long)... food markouts on days we're not working. my sm briefly explained it to me when i was hired but i didn't understand fully how it worked. i think she said we can only mark out food on days we work. if we plan to come in on our day off, we could mark out a food for that day. how does that work? for example, i know i will want a blueberry muffin on my day off. do i just mark out a blueberry muffin then come in on my day off and tell the barista working i already marked out a muffin? is there something else i'm missing? how do they know we marked it out? do they check? i can see how that could possibly be abused.",1661664619,question food drink markout still fairli new i work part time month i feel like i fulli util markout i want get much as i i feel like i m leav money food on tabl onli goe back to benefit a big corpor anyway i usual come 15 min my shift and get a free coffe work i usual get a free sandwich and ice tea that two free drink and one food markout i know say get three free drink per shift that free drink onli access my shift on my break can i get my free coffe befor my shift and two free drink i leav okay then food markout we get seven food markout a week i usual onli work four day a week i ve work three day week and go in tomorrow sunday like i said i usual onli get a sandwich or other food item everytim i work that s three food markout i ve use thi week i four left that mean tomorrow i can go home four free food item and i do that i ve bought one food item befor and when i select partner food onli appli it to one item then charg discount price for the other item on the po do i have select item in the order and appli partner food or do i have to do separ transact for each item and appli partner food on each transact last question i know i ve gone on long food markout on day we work my sm briefli explain it to me when i hire i t understand fulli how it work i think said we can onli mark food on day we work we plan to come in on day we could mark out a food for that day how doe that work for exampl i know i want a blueberri muffin on my day off do i mark out a blueberri muffin then come in on my day off and tell the barista work i alreadi mark out a muffin is someth els i m miss how do they know we mark it out do they check i can see how that could possibl abus

4494,0,"can this one supervisor who has a serious problem with me get me fired? can anyone give me an honest second opinion on how i'm doing, how bad my mistakes are, and what to do with this one supervisor who has a lot of issues with me? i'm afraid i'm in a lot of trouble, and i honestly don't know what to do at this point.
i've been working at starbucks for about a month and 2 weeks, including training. i'm still struggling a lot. it's a combination of things that are making me feel behind, but if i had to simplify it then i'd say it's a mix of subpar training and my natural tendency to be bad at details.
i trained at a different store because there were a lot of new hires. a lot of the training was online. i was able to practice a bit of cs and p.o.s. and i only got about 2 days on bar. there were a lot of things i was only told or shown once very quickly with little to no practice that i had a hard time remembering.
i was lucky enough to get retrained for 3 more days after a few weeks of a lot of mistakes, and i feel a lot better with the job. the only issue is that now everyone knows me as an anxious mess so i'm not well respected. some people are nice but others don't give me the benefit of the doubt anymore. i feel more secure in my knowledge of the job now because i had a chance to ask all my questions, and get told all the rules and terms i didn't even know existed up until that point. but i'm still working on speed and accuracy. i generally am bad with nit picky details. so even when i know what to do i mess up a lot, particularly on pos. (eg. accidentally charging for milk when you shouldn't, accidentally scanning rtdne items twice)
so, one of my shifts is really fed up with me. she's new to the store and is a very detail oriented person. knows how to do her job fairly well since she's been at it for so long but in my opinion has difficulty with in the moment improvisation, which i feel is equally important. i feel like much of the time things inevitably can go wrong or slower than expected but she typically struggles to adapt to it and gets visibly frustrated. in moments like this she struggles with multitasking and lacks the ability to give clear instructions while she's doing other things. most people don't get in any trouble for it because they already know how to do their jobs even without her instruction and have a reputation for being good at what they do already.
she's definitely more by the book than my other shifts. she always picks up on the little details i miss and gets really upset with me. sometimes she feels guilty and starts being nice out of nowhere, but ultimately always falls back on getting openly fed up with me for something or another. even off the floor she thinks i'm incompetent and doesn't trust that i have any common sense. she doubts most things that i say even while we're having small talk. and hasn't asked me for permission before keeping me late twice now. whenever something is off i'm the first person she blames for it. i get that sometimes i get anxious and have trouble doing the job completely correctly but she doesn't respect me as a person. she's open to other people about how much i hold her back and i feel like if i can't do my job perfectly in the next few days she's going to try to get me fired. she openly can't stand me and looks exasperated just being around me. she's right to be upset, there are a lot of things she's had to tell me to do multiple times that i blatantly can't remember or get right. but i feel completely and utterly disrespected by her in general and i think she truly has a problem with me.
that said, do shifts have a lot of authority over who gets let go or at least in a lot of trouble?
if you asked my other coworkers or shifts then they probably wouldn't think i'm very competent either. but when my other shifts notice me make mistakes they are way more forgiving or able to improvise with it as it happens even if they are frustrated for a second.
so yeah i keep making small detail oriented mistakes. more examples would be queueing shots before milk.. fumbling with cash.. being slow on cs.. asking if they want sweetener for the wrong drinks... not putting names on every order...
i understand that my mistakes slow down the rest of the floor and i feel truly remorseful for it. but i feel like no matter how much i try to write down and retain, my inability to be detail oriented always comes around. i can't stop messing up. and if i don't get better soon, this lady's issue with me could get serious. i don't know what to do.",1661647578,one supervisor seriou problem get me fire can anyon give me honest second opinion how bad mistak with thi one supervisor who ha a lot issu with me i m afraid i m a lot of troubl and i honestli know what to do thi point i work at a month and 2 week includ train i m still struggl a lot a combin of thing are make me feel behind i to simplifi it i say it s a mix of subpar train and my natur tendenc to bad at detail i train at a differ store a lot of new hire a lot of train onlin i wa abl to practic a bit of cs and p s and i got about 2 day on bar there were a lot of thing i wa onli told shown quickli with littl to practic that i had a hard time rememb i wa lucki enough to get retrain for 3 day a week of a lot of mistak and i feel a lot better with the job the onli issu that everyon know me an anxiou mess i m well respect peopl are nice but other don t give me the benefit of the doubt anymor i feel more secur in my knowledg of the job now becaus i had a chanc to ask my question and get told all the rule and term i t even know exist that point but i m still work on speed and accuraci i gener bad with nit picki detail so even i know what to do i mess up a lot particularli on po eg accident charg for milk when t accident scan rtdne item twice so one of my shift is realli fed up with me s new to the store and is a veri detail orient person know how to do job fairli well sinc she s been at it for so long but in my opinion ha difficulti with in the moment improvis i feel is equal import i feel like much of the time thing inevit can go wrong or slower expect but she typic struggl to adapt to it and get visibl frustrat in moment like thi she struggl with multitask and lack the abil to give clear instruct she s do thing peopl don t get in troubl for it becaus alreadi know how to do job even without her instruct and a reput for good at what they do alreadi she s definit more the book than my other shift she alway pick up on the littl detail i miss and get realli upset with me sometim she feel guilti and start be nice of nowher but ultim alway fall back on get openli fed up with me for someth or anoth even the floor she think i m incompet and t trust that i have ani common sens she doubt most thing that i say even while small talk and t ask me for permiss keep me late twice now whenev someth is off i m the first person she blame for it i get that sometim i get anxiou and have troubl do the job complet correctli but she doesn t respect me as a person she s open to other peopl about how much i hold her back and i feel like if i can t do my job perfectli in the next few day she s go to tri to get me fire she openli can t stand me and look exasper be around me she s right to be upset there are a lot of thing she s had to tell me to do multipl time that i blatantli can t rememb or get right but i feel complet and utterli disrespect by her in gener and i think she truli ha a problem with me that said do shift have a lot of author who get let go or at least in a lot of troubl if you ask my other cowork or shift then they probabl t think i m veri compet either but when my other shift notic me make mistak they are way more forgiv or abl to improvis with it as it happen even if they are frustrat for a second so yeah i keep make small detail orient mistak more exampl would be queue shot befor milk fumbl with cash be slow on cs ask if they want sweeten for the wrong drink not put name on everi order i understand that my mistak slow the rest of the floor and i feel truli remors for it but i feel like no matter how much i tri to write down and retain my inabl to be detail orient alway come around i can t stop mess up and if i don t get better soon thi ladi s issu with me could get seriou i don t know what to do

so, one of my shifts is really fed up with me. she's new to the store and is a very detail oriented person. knows how to do her job fairly well since she's been at it for so long but in my opinion has difficulty with in the moment improvisation, which i feel is equally important. i feel like much of the time things inevitably can go wrong or slower than expected but she typically struggles to adapt to it and gets visibly way too frustrated. in moments like these she struggles with multitasking and lacks the ability to give clear instructions while doing other things. most people don't get in any trouble for it because they already know how to do their jobs even without her instruction, and have a reputation for being good at what they do already.
she's definitely more by the book than my other shifts. she always picks up on the little details i miss and gets really upset with me. sometimes she feels guilty and starts being nice out of nowhere, but ultimately always falls back on getting openly fed up with me for something or another. even off the floor she thinks i'm incompetent and doesn't trust that i have any common sense. she doubts most things that i say even while we're having small talk. and hasn't asked me for permission before keeping me late twice now. whenever something is off i'm the first person she blames for it. i get that sometimes i get anxious and have trouble doing the job completely correctly but she doesn't respect me as a person. she's open to other people about how much i hold her back and i feel like if i can't do my job perfectly in the next few days she's going to try to get me fired. she openly can't stand me and looks exasperated just being around me. she's right to be upset, there are a lot of things she's had to tell me to do multiple times that i blatantly can't remember or get right. but i feel completely and utterly disrespected by her in general and i think she truly has a problem with me.
that said, do shifts have a lot of authority over who gets let go or at least in a lot of trouble?
if you asked my other coworkers or shifts then they probably wouldn't think i'm very competent either. but when my other shifts notice me make mistakes they are way more forgiving or able to improvise with it as it happens even if they are frustrated for a second.
so yeah i keep making detail oriented mistakes in particular. more examples would be queueing shots before milk.. fumbling with cash.. being slow on cs.. asking if they want sweetener for the wrong drinks... not putting names on every order... things are always a bit less smooth when i'm on the floor. more people are waiting, we fall more behind...
no matter what i do i always miss something. i understand that my mistakes affect everyone on the floor and i truly feel remorseful for it. i've been taking notes and trying my best to get everything. but the details are really hard for me for me to remember in the moment and i feel like if i can't get it perfectly asap then this one meticulous and rule bound shift is going to try her best to get rid of me. she absolutely hates me and i don't feel respected by her as a human being. i don't know what to do.",1661645046,think one shift go tri to get fire anyon give me honest second opinion i how bad my mistak to one supervisor lot of issu with me i m afraid i m a lot of troubl and i honestli know what to do thi point i work at a month and 2 week includ train i m still struggl a lot a combin of thing are make me feel behind i to simplifi it i say it s a mix of subpar train and my natur tendenc to bad at detail i train at a differ store a lot of new hire a lot of train onlin i wa abl to practic a bit of cs and p s but i got about 2 day on bar there were a lot of thing i wa onli told shown quickli with littl to practic that i had a hard time rememb i wa lucki enough to get retrain for 3 day a week of a lot of mistak and i feel a lot better with the job the onli issu is that everyon know me an anxiou mess i m well respect peopl are nice but other don t give me the benefit of the doubt anymor i feel more secur in my knowledg of the job now becaus i had a chanc to ask my question and get told all the rule and term i t even know exist that point but i m still work on speed and accuraci i gener bad with nit picki detail so even i know what to do i mess up a lot particularli on po eg accident charg for milk when t accident scan rtdne item twice peopl are pay so one of my shift is realli fed up with me s new to the store and is a veri detail orient person know how to do job fairli well sinc she s been at it for so long but in my opinion ha difficulti with in the moment improvis i feel is equal import i feel like much of the time thing inevit can go wrong or slower expect but she typic struggl to adapt to it and get visibl way frustrat in moment like she struggl with multitask and lack the abil to give clear instruct while do thing peopl don t get in troubl for it becaus alreadi know how to do job even without her instruct and a reput for good at what they do alreadi she s definit more the book than my other shift she alway pick up on the littl detail i miss and get realli upset with me sometim she feel guilti and start be nice of nowher but ultim alway fall back on get openli fed up with me for someth or anoth even the floor she think i m incompet and t trust that i have ani common sens she doubt most thing that i say even while small talk and t ask me for permiss keep me late twice now whenev someth is off i m the first person she blame for it i get that sometim i get anxiou and have troubl do the job complet correctli but she doesn t respect me as a person she s open to other peopl about how much i hold her back and i feel like if i can t do my job perfectli in the next few day she s go to tri to get me fire she openli can t stand me and look exasper be around me she s right to be upset there are a lot of thing she s had to tell me to do multipl time that i blatantli can t rememb or get right but i feel complet and utterli disrespect by her in gener and i think she truli ha a problem with me that said do shift have a lot of author who get let go or at least in a lot of troubl if you ask my other cowork or shift then they probabl t think i m veri compet either but when my other shift notic me make mistak they are way more forgiv or abl to improvis with it as it happen even if they are frustrat for a second so yeah i keep make detail orient mistak in particular more exampl would be queue shot befor milk fumbl with cash be slow on cs ask if they want sweeten for the wrong drink not put name on everi order thing are alway a bit less smooth when i m on the floor more peopl are wait we fall more behind no matter what i do i alway miss someth i understand that my mistak affect everyon on the floor and i truli feel remors for it i ve been take note and tri my best to get everyth but the detail are realli hard for me for me to rememb in the moment and i feel like if i can t get it perfectli asap then thi one meticul and rule bound shift is go to tri her best to get rid of me she absolut hate me and i don t feel respect by her as a human be i don t know what to do

every time my mood dims just a little more. i say sure, give them their items, receipt if they want it, and get them out of there as soon as possible. and the next car up pays for their drinks just like everyone else.

i'm trying to find options for caffeinated beverage that i can stand the taste of. my college campus has a starbucks so i figure something there is my best shot. here's a run down of what i've tried so far.
1. i like the idea of tea but no matter what i try it's always too watery and weak. when brewing at home i experimented and got to 1 tea bag per 2oz of water before giving. the only success i've had is peach snapple and that's more like juice.
2. i've found i like starbucks chai lattes if i add an extra pump of chai. i'm interested in trying other tea lattes but i don't think starbucks has those so that's not really relevant.
3. i can't stand the bitterness of coffee. last fall i tried the apple pie latte (think that's what it was called) and was optimistic because i love apple stuff but the bitterness off the coffee was too much. i tried a frappe, cookie crumble i think, and i could still taste the coffee too much. honestly tasting the coffee at all will probably be too much.
with all of this in mind, do any of you have recommendations for caffeinated drinks at starbucks i can try?
also, how terrible are ""secret menu"" items on baristas? especially interested in hearing from any student workers on here who worked at their college's starbucks. i know there's not an actual secret menu so just adding a bunch of stuff. i found some based off the chai drinks that could make for some nice variety but i don't want to if it's something that's a pain in the butt for the person making it.
any advice would be really appreciated. i don't want to keep buying drinks i can't stand to finish but really want to find some way to consume caffeine.

i think the existence of such a game will reduce the training time, and resources spent training and will be a quality of life improvement for baristas trying to learn! it will make us learn quickly so we can go through all the recipes and learn more quickly. new recipes can also be added quickly if training can be done quickly.

4610,0,"service dog clarifications i see a lot of posts about ""service dogs"" and esas and general pets in starbucks.
pets and esas are not allowed.
service dogs are.
we are allowed to ask two questions; whether the dog is a service dog and what tasks they are trained for aiding in a disability. you cannot ask about the disability (visible or not) and you cannot require the dog to wear a vest or be visibly identified as a service dog, ask them to perform a task, require the handler to present paperwork confirming the dog is a service animal or about their disability (the list goes on and you can read more on the website i linked)
generally, many service dogs will be wearing vests or be visibly identifiable as a service dog. but again, not required. they are also not required to be on a leash only if the tasks they are trained for require the dog to be off leash (ex. getting help if the handler faints or has a medical spell, retrieving items, etc etc).
please do not get yourself or your store into legal trouble for not following the law. you can legally ask those who are not in control of their dogs to leave, especially if they decide to treat a cafe floor as a restroom. be assertive but try not to escalate the situation.

is it possible the offer letter lists the other location because the manager who's hiring me is from that location but is hiring for this other location (the one i planned on being at), so she will transfer my account over to this location in the system? or does this mean i'm hired for her location rather than the one i was interviewed at? has anyone here ever been hired by a manager for another location?

4677,0,"regarding the levels of sugar in many popular drinks...if anyone is trying to consume less added sugar in their drinks, here are some quick tips. no shame if you want to enjoy all the sugar though! you do you! you can always ask the barista or look in the app to see the drink recipe. many drinks have classic syrup in them. you can substitute this with stevia packets, which is what i do. it has a slightly different taste but you can get used to it over time until you won't notice it or won't mind it. i love getting my drinks with stevia instead! you can ask the barista to make it with stevia or you can add the stevia yourself later. i recommend adding it yourself until you know how much you like.
you can also try the drink without sweetener. some of the frappuccino's, like the matcha creme frap, don't need any sweetener in my opinion.
i am not a dietician, but this is what i do to limit the added sugar in my drinks!
i also usually get nonfat milk instead of whole milk for some drinks, and that makes the drink less calories overall. for frappuccino's though, they come out too icy with nonfat milk, in my opinion, so i do 2% for frappuccino's.
no shame in however you like your drinks but if you do want to reduce sugar or calories, this is what i do, and i still really enjoy my drinks!",1661488549,regard level sugar mani popular drink anyon tri consum less ad sugar in drink quick tip shame if want to enjoy the sugar though you you you alway ask the barista look in the app to see the drink recip mani drink classic syrup in you can substitut stevia packet is do slightli differ tast you can get use to it time you notic it or won t mind it i love get drink with stevia instead you can ask the barista to make it with stevia or you can add the stevia later i recommend ad it yourself until you know much you like you can also tri the drink without sweeten some of the frappuccino like the matcha creme frap t need sweeten in my opinion i a dietician but thi is what i do to limit the ad sugar in my drink i also usual get nonfat milk instead of whole milk some drink make the drink less calori overal for frappuccino s though come ici with nonfat milk in my opinion i do 2 for frappuccino s no shame in howev you like drink but if you do want to reduc sugar or calori thi is what i do and i still realli enjoy my drink

(venti rant/advice needed) as the title says, i put in a transfer request 2 months ago because i was moving off to college. i let my then-sm know, and found a store in my college town that was willing to accept me.
right after i let my old sm know i was wanting to transfer, they left for another store. they weren't able to transfer me before they left, and them leaving pretty much put my old store into sm purgatory. from the moment they left to until when i moved, we never had a permanent sm. we alternated between being watched over by an asm-in-training, an sm-in-training, and an sm of another store in our district that was training to be dm. despite this, i was assured multiple times that my transfer would be completed in time for me to move.
that didn't happen, though. to this day, i'm still in the system as working at my old store. i bothered the shit out of everyone i could think of, hoping that *someone* could help me transfer, but to no avail. i was told that since my old store doesn't officially have an sm, no one has ""access"" to transfer me except the dm, who seems either unable or unwilling to.
to make matters worse, the sm at my new store told me that i would start this week but i've only worked two shifts so far and i'm currently not scheduled *at all* for this week, next week, or the week after. my new sm says he'll fix it, but that was a couple of days ago and nothing's changed. i texted him again earlier today and haven't heard anything back.
i'm really fucking stressed about it and don't know what to do. my new store is low-volume and cafe-only, so i'm scared that there just isn't enough room to fit me into the schedule. i'm also scared that my new sm is already sick of dealing with me and doesn't want me to work at his store anymore.
i'm not really in the position where i can afford to not work for 2-3 weeks/indefinitely. i honestly really enjoy working at starbucks - the pay is decent compared to similar jobs, getting off at 11 or 12 is really convenient as a college student, and i'm good at my job. it's upsetting that i'm being forced to consider quitting a job i like for something i don't really feel is my fault.

i was curious what my options are? i'm scared to bring any of this up to my sm or anyone in case of any type of ill-will or retaliation of some sort. my store is very understaffed and several other partners made it clear i was being rushed through training. i also of course do feel bad ditching them so soon especially since everyone there has been incredibly nice to me. idk if starbucks as a corporation will see me as a waste of their time and decide i'm not reliable enough to rehire.
should i tell my sm about my new life changes? should i put in my 2-weeks a week or two before my 3 months have finished? what issues would this cause for me? would i have to start training all over again at a new store in my new city? would starbucks even hire me again after this?

4733,0,"question re:shaken espresso vs latte i was at an sbux inside a grocery store recently and wanted a latte for while i shopped. i ordered my usual - venti iced latte with hazelnut and oat milk if you have it. the lady kinda gave me a quizzical look and said ""oh, you want the shaken oat milk espresso?"" i said no, just a latte will be fine, no shaking needed. again, weird look, then she went to make it.
i picked it up and immediately knew something was off. the syrup was sitting at the bottom of the drink, not incorporated at all, and the drink overall just ended up tasting weird. i'm still not sure what it was but it didn't taste at all like a latte usually does from any other store.
so my question is - should i have just accepted that she wanted to make me a shaken espresso drink? did she *try* to make the espresso drink instead of my latte and it didn't work out because yknow they're different drinks? i'm just curious as to what happened to make it so.....bleh. it's just espresso, milk, ice, and syrup. and unmixed syrup at that. i tried throwing my head back when i drank the first few sips to mix it and it just wasn't working.

my order has been a caramel frappuccino w/ extra ice, extra caramel, double blended in a venti cup.
usually i'll order and i don't get any feedback and if i'm at a new starbucks i preface it by saying i have a complicated order just in case. i don't order if the line is long and i never complain if it's not in a venti cup. i do not expect the cup to be full. i do expect to be charged for extra caramel. if there was a charge for the cup, i have paid that, too. i work in retail so my ice melts in the back room while i'm assisting guests. the extra ice helps my drink last a while longer.
today i ordered and after reading back my order, i asked the barista if she heard me ask for a venti cup. it flashed on the screen a couple of times like she couldn't find the right button, so when she told me to pull up, i didn't think anything of it. when i get to the window, it's in a grande cup. i didn't complain or anything but after reading a bit here i am wondering if that was intentional?
i don't want to be a bad customer. can i make this less annoying for them? should i go drop off some chocolates for being annoying? idk??

4841,0,"ssv who is racist and a bully to partners especially green beans how long does ethics give decision after the investigation?
this will be a pretty long story/rant. please try to understand as english is not my first language
2 partners filed an ethics complaint plus 2 incident reports (a witness report and a green bean) against the same ssv.
ssv apparently called a partner from a minority a slave. partner reported the incident to the manager but manager just shrugged the incident off and even told the partner to not tell it to other partners as manager is afraid that other partners will get mad at ssv and will bully ssv. we already knew that this ssv and sm are particularly close and lets ssv gets away from any complaints. instead of giving ssv corrective action or coaching for the racism issue, sm nitpicks on the partner for every little thing even some things aren't true. there was also a second time with the same partner where ssv asked if partner lives on a gh**to area. partner also reported the incident but nothing was done. so we convinced partner to call ethics instead. partner was able to talk to the dm before they moved to another province. partner later found out that our sm called the store sm that they're going to transfer to and said bad things about partner to prevent partner from being accepted to the store.
another ethics complaint and 2 ir are related.
ssv aggressively followed a green bean from inside the store to the parking lot and yelled at green bean in front of many customers and partners which i feel is against third place policy and anti-harassment. even though green bean didn't notify ssv (which ssv is hardly on the floor working) that gb clocked out, ssv should just coach gb properly. gb told the incident to sm but blamed gb instead on how gb is being inconsiderate and non-cooperative. gb told another ssv about what happened and felt it was unfair so they filed a complaint for gb. gb and other witnesses also filed incident reports which notified our sm and it pissed our sm off. the investigation started 2 weeks ago where dm asked people who filed the ir and complaints as well as other baristas.
many partners also talked to ssv and sm directly on how ssv is being aggressive and acting like a bully to other partners(especially green beans) instead of coaching them properly but nothing happens to ssv instead sm nitpicks/blames partners who complains about ssv and sometimes would cut their hours.
tl;dr
partners filed ethics complaints and incident reports against the same ssv for racism and being a bully towards green beans. partners tried to have a talk several times with ssv and sm for the aggressive behavior but no corrective action is taken and sm is always covering up ssv. investigation was started 2-3 weeks ago and partners are losing hope that the results will still fall into ssv's favor. how long will it take till they would release the decision if they're going to transfer the ssv?",1661317644,ssv racist bulli partner especi green bean long ethic give decis investig a pretti long stori rant pleas tri to understand english is first languag 2 partner file ethic complaint plu 2 incid report a wit report and a green bean the ssv ssv appar call a partner a minor a slave partner report the incid to the manag manag shrug the incid and even told the partner to not tell to partner as manag is afraid other partner will get mad ssv and will bulli ssv alreadi knew that thi ssv and sm particularli close and let ssv get away from complaint instead give ssv correct action coach the racism issu sm nitpick the partner for everi littl thing even thing true also a second time the same partner ssv ask partner live on a gh to area partner also report the incid but noth wa done we convinc partner to call ethic instead partner wa abl to talk to the dm move to anoth provinc partner later found that sm call the store sm that they go to transfer to and said bad thing partner to prevent partner from accept to the store anoth ethic complaint and 2 ir are relat ssv aggress follow a green bean from insid the store to the park lot and yell at green bean front of mani custom and partner feel is against third place polici and anti harass even though green bean t notifi ssv which ssv is hardli on the floor work that gb clock out ssv just coach gb properli gb told the incid to sm but blame gb instead on how gb is be inconsider and non cooper gb told anoth ssv about happen and felt it wa unfair so they file a complaint for gb gb and other wit also file incid report which notifi our sm and it piss our sm off the investig start 2 week ago where dm ask peopl who file the ir and complaint as well as other barista mani partner also talk to ssv and sm directli on how ssv is be aggress and act like a bulli to other partner especi green bean instead of coach properli but noth happen to ssv instead sm nitpick blame partner who complain about ssv and sometim would cut hour tl dr partner file ethic complaint and incid report against the same ssv for racism and be a bulli toward green bean partner tri to a talk sever time with ssv and sm for the aggress behavior but correct action is taken and sm is alway cover ssv investig wa start 2 3 week ago and partner are lose hope that the result will still fall ssv favor how long will it take till they would releas the decis if they re go to transfer the ssv

4866,0,"new barista s.o.s (long read) depending on how liberal you use the word. 2 months may not be considered new to you but i feel like there's still so much for me to learn. one major one being social interactions lol.
you see that ""lol""? i added that to lighten the *mood* but i really feel like things are getting bad. id consider myself a ugly duckling. wasn't the most pleasing guy to look and the ugly friend of my group when i was younger to being told by men and women i'm really good looking often and all my friends sort of following my lead. all that is cool and all but it causes a lot of unwanted attention for a man who still hasn't left their ugly duck mindset.
it may seems like i'm being braggadocios i apologize if anyone is taking it that way but i'm only pointing this out because i feel like its effecting my work. so as we all know starbucks is a very female dominated brand. from the customers to the staff (at least in my store) i'm starting to have women compliment me a lot. which is so cool because i know a lot of people are shy but i have no idea how to respond without being awkward.
i don't want to come off as unapproachable but i keep messing these things up dude. a lot of the time i wouldn't mind having a conversation with these folks but i get shy around new people and overthink. i don't want to get fired over this. most of my partners are great people but a select few feel like i'm favored by our manager and critique everything i do. starbucks is supposed to be a social place! my manger is the best she always gives me reassurance but i'm starting to think that's just because she may fancy me (not just based of that, there are other things i don't need to go in detail about)
i don't want anyone to think i'm unapproachable or stuck up when i'm really just to in my own head. i have a fellow barista who is pretty cute she looks like zoe kravitz who's my celebrity crush. this girl has thrown me so many ""just fucking interact with me you curly headed bastard"" signs and tried sparking conversations and i still overthink saying a simple hi and bye to her
you may read that thinking *""how can you know all this and not be confident enough to converse""* and it comes down to being that guy who would think someone is flirting with him when they were actually doing the complete opposite. i'm not dumb after awhile i can start to tell this isn't just them being nice but id rather deny and be safe then sorry.
i hope this didn't come off too dating advice-ey because at the end of the day my fear comes from losing my job and intimidating others, not loss of possible dates.

fast forward to july. i get my training started, but my numbers don't work for anything - the register, my benefits, etc. my manager says ""i'll have to look into it"". as the weeks go by, nothing changes and i'm not getting paid either. i contacted partner support for help. they tell me i'm stuck in pre hire because my original hiring paperwork was never finished and had expired months ago. all my manager needed to do was fill out some new paperwork and restart the onboarding process. it was that simple. as of a few days ago, i'm officially hired, but still waiting for my payment...

ex-partner x2 here. i worked at starbucks 2013-2018, then mar 2021 - oct 2021 before landing (what i thought was) a more stable full time job.
spoiler alert: it was not.
now i'm thinking about returning to starbucks. i will say, i definitely enjoyed my time during my first five years more than i enjoyed it this last time. with the recipe changes, new policies, covid, it wasn't my favorite - plus i was starting at an extremely high volume store for our area, and they didn't really train me again because i'd spent five years with the company previously. (which is whatever, but things had changed, so it would've been nice to know them beforehand and not told them while doing something wrong on the floor.)
i don't think the pay has changed for every store in my area, though. last year, i was making $13 for the few months i spent as a ssv, but i know they were talking about raising pay. i see barista postings on indeed around here from $10-$15 an hour, so who knows.
but i'm only making $16 now, they're cutting my hours, and i'm considering moving back to the bux and working my way up this time. as long as i can find a location around me paying at least $15.
so. baristas and ssvs of reddit, how are we liking it nowadays? i know the company is under a lot of fire for the union stuff, but as a day to day job, how are we feeling? pros/cons? advice? etc?

4993,0,"no one at my store uses shakers for refreshers/teas... like literally nobody just transferred to a new store (it's my 3rd one) and everyone just pours shit directly into the cup including inclusions without shaking it... so that everything looks separated and the proportions are everywhere.
like i understand maybe doing it when there's a rush (i'm def guilty) but even then, if you're quick with it, using the shakers really doesn't take more time than putting it all in the cup.
