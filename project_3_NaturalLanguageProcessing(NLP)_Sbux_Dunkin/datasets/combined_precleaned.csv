3,1,"On the door dash app whenever I order drinks such as the ice tea, it never tastes the same compared to when I order from the drive thru or in store.

This also applies to the ice coffees and I since stopped ordering them because they were tasting bad.

The hot Dunkaccinos were my favorite drink, and now all of my Dunkins seemingly have finally gotten rid of them. Yes, I did live in a place where we still had them until like, a week ago.

This year, however, they fixed the AC on July (because the district manager had to actually spend time in the store to train a new manager so she finally saw that it was 95 Fahrenheit in here and decided she should do something because she's suffering) 

Anyways we haven't been keeping the back door open but we still have a lot of fruit flies. We all know about it. But nobody will do anything about it. I've tried to have the crew clean like crazy but they keep only putting 3 people on for days and we literally don't even get time to take breaks (even though my manager keeps taking the breaks out of our paycheck) 

So we can't clean...not even at night bc they keep complaining about labor so day crew has to vanish as soon as their shift is over and we can't clean up so night crew has to clean our mess. 

Every now and then I try to clean out the drains but most of the drains are so filled with stuff that they don't even DRAIN. This is something thats also been a problem for years. 

The thing that threw me over the edge today was finding a fruit fly crawling on sandwich station. It immediately made me want to close the store down. And then...I found one in the coffee cup I was preparing. Just drowning in the cream. 

I know that the only way anything will happen is if someone calls someone outside of the store to do something about it. Because they've been known about it and haven't done anything besides get 1 trap like 2 months ago....

They got really upset at me, and even started cussing and saying, what the fuck is this, where the fuck is my freedom at? I told them to make the number accurate and I walked away. The other baker gave their input and said 8 less BC isn't that much. I got even more pissed lol. What do I do? I'm the assistant manager. The manager was in the store as well, and was too tired to deal with it. I used to be a baker too."

262,1,"I have an interview with Dunkin Donuts in a few days. The job is a crew member. My responsibilities will include but will not be limited to thoroughly cleaning tables, obeying safety and sanitation guidelines, handling cash register transactions and pouring coffee. 

I have done research to find out what types of questions I can expect to receive during the interview. Below is a list of possible questions and the answers I have drafted. I will gladly accept any feedback. It is doubtful that every single one of these questions would be asked, but some of them will and I don‚Äôt know which ones will and which ones won‚Äôt be asked, so I need to be prepared. Please focus not on how likely it is that I will be asked these questions, but on whether or not the answers I have drafted would make sense had these questions been asked. 

**What are your strengths**?

I am a quick learner. I am enthusiastic and hungry to learn. Furthermore, I take criticism really well. If I have done something wrong, I want to be told what I did wrong. Therefore, you will never have to worry about me making the same mistake twice. 

**What is your biggest weakness**? 

With what little work experience I have, I am a work in progress. However, being so new to this profession, I can be shaped into the perfect employee. 

**What are your career goals**?

At the moment, I am in a discovery phase. In an attempt to find myself, I want a job that will remind me about the value of hard work and enable me to challenge myself. I hope to be able to multitask, so that I may learn, grow and develop. 

**Where do you see yourself five years from now**? 

Five years from now, I plan to still be working here. Hopefully, I will have contributed to the company enough to be seen as a trusted and reliable member of my team. While still in the ame role, I would have a wide range of responsibilities. I would be the go to person for advice and expertise in my area. 

**When are you available to work**?

I am available to work anytime. 

**Tell me about yourself**.

There is so much to tell, it is hard to know where to begin. 

In undergrad, I completed an internship working on nightly and weekend programming. This job enabled me to work with students who had learning disabilities. I would help to coordinate events. I would help with the set up and clean up. During the event itself, I would interact with the students and ensure that they were having a good time and obeying all school rules. If I am hired to work at Dunkin Donuts, it would be my job to ensure that the customers have a pleasant experience. 

**Walk me through your resume**.  

I have done landscaping jobs before. I once shovelled snow out of the driveway of a customer who was unable to shovel himself due to back problems. I was self-employed and the pay was not steady. I had to seek out opportunities for work. I did not have the same sense or order that I would have at a job that takes place in a building where I punch in and punch out. That is why I would like a job like this, where I am told when to show up and what to do when I am here. 

I recently finished school. My major was psychology. I knew that the courses that I took in school were no guarantee of figuring out what I wanted to do with my life. However, by understanding human nature, I would be able to better understand the world, which would help me connect with people and figure out how to find work. 

My last semester of undergrad, I worked an unpaid internship on nightly and weekend programming for the Thames program. The Thames program at Mitchell College is a program for students with learning disabilities. I assisted with the prep work, set up and cleaned up for many events. During these events, I would interact with and act as a role model for younger students. As an intern, there was a degree of creativity involved with the job, but for the most part, I followed orders given to me by my supervisor. I foresee this job as one that is mostly about obeying an employer. I intend to set up the place to open and/or clean up the place before leaving after closing. 

**How did you hear about this job**?

I received an email notification from Indeed.com. I like challenges. This job is physically demanding, because you have to lift objects that weigh as much as 35 pounds. The job is also socially challenging, you must greet customers and ensure that people have a pleasant experience when the people in question are complete strangers and you do not know what they like. This job sounds challenging in a good way. This job sounds exactly like a challenging task I have been looking for this whole time. 

**Why do you want to work at this company**? 

I want to work at Dunkin Donuts, because the clientele is very diverse and should provide an opportunity to meet new people and learn new things. 

This restaurant's target demographic is the working class. These are the people who come here to get a coffee and a sausage egg and cheese sandwich right before work. I take great joy in my genuine desire to make life easier or more convenient for the average American. 

**Why should we hire you**? 

My biggest strength and potential contribution to the company would have to be that I am a team player. In a restaurant staff, it is expected that we, as workers, take care of our own and put the needs of the customers first. Having majored in Behaviour Science in undergrad, I have learned how to get along with people and work as a team. When I did community service for Sacred Heart School in Taftville, I would be assigned a task and expected to do it under a time constraint, as the cafeteria was supposed to be used by someone else for something else at an allotted time. Therefore, I know how to not only do a good job, but complete a job by a strict deadline. Also, I was a student-athlete in high school. From this experience, I built up stamina and learned to multi-task. 

**When did you have to work under stress? How did you handle it**?

When I completed an internship in undergrad, I had to complete 100 hours by the end of the semester. I dealt with that stress the same way I dealt with any other form of stress, by using the one year rule. If ever I am stressed about anything, I simply ask myself, will this still be on my mind in a year? If the answer is no, then logically there is no reason to be worried, as it will all blow over in 365 days or less. If, however, the answer is yes, then there is still no reason to be worried, as even if things do not go as planned, there will be plenty more opportunities to rectify what went wrong. I also ask myself this one question. What is the worst thing that can happen? Stress is what you feel when you are not sure what the outcome will be and you know that the outcome could be undesirable. When you take a driving test, you feel stressed, because you might not pass. If you ask yourself what the worst thing that can happen is, you may be surprised to discover that the worst thing that can happen is not only pretty unlikely to happen in the first place, if it were to happen, it would not be that bad. 

**Do you prefer to work alone or as part of a team**? 

I like to work as part of a team. I also enjoy working alone with close supervision. When I did my internship in college, I would interact with my supervisors, the other interns and my teacher. It was all up to me to ensure that I fulfilled my responsibilities. I was supervised in regards to the jobs that I did for the school, but it was my responsibility to ensure that my work was completed in time. 

**How would you deal with a conflict**?

If ever I dealt with a conflict, whether it be work related or inter personal, I would say to the other person the following; 

‚ÄúIt seems to me that you are upset or angry that something has been done wrong. Would you please tell me what I have done wrong, why it was wrong and what, if anything, can be done to improve the situation?‚Äù 

That is verbatim what I would say in response to a complaint.

**How would you remain motivated in your work**?

I consistently ask myself; Am I a better person than I was a year ago? And what do I need to do to become better over the course of the next 365 days? I think of it in terms of years, not days. Everyone has bad days. You don‚Äôt know if you will improve from one day to the next, but there is no excuse for regressing from one year to the next. 

**What is your ideal working environment**?

My ideal working environment is one where everyone makes it a priority to build others up. No one is perfect. When a fellow worker makes a mistake, the appropriate response is to either correct the mistake or teach the person who made the mistake to correct it himself or herself. This expectation should apply in all directions, employee toward employer, employer toward employee and employee toward other employee.  

**Is there anything you have done in the past that you wish you had done differently**? 

When I did community service for Sacred Heart school, I was tasked with vacuuming the carpets. I unplugged the vacuum cleaner before turning it off. I received a shock.  

**If you have a day when you are not busy, what would you do**?

I would ask my supervisor if anything else needs to be done, hoping he or she has a task for me. 

**Why is it important for all policies and standards to be obeyed**?

Policies, procedures and standards are set in place with the intent to work toward a common goal. If some people in a staff or faculty disobey policies, a common goal will never be achieved. 

**When can you start? When are you available**?

I am capable of beginning immediately. I am available to work any shift. 

**Are you able to travel**? 

Although I do not have my own vehicle, I will have transportation for scheduled shifts. 

**Do you have any experience working in fast food**? 

I do not. 

**Why are you interested in working with us**? 

I am a regular customer of Dunkin Donuts. Every product, the donuts, coffee, hot chocolate, and breakfast sandwiches are amazing. I am impressed by the quality of the products, not to mention the customer service. If I work here, I can spread joy through a cup of coffee and make customers loyal to the brand. Furthermore, the fast paced environment is my ideal workplace. 

**What do you know about the company**? 

When William Rosenberg founded Dunkin Donuts in 1950, the company first did business in Quincy Massachusetts. The slogan ‚ÄúAmerica runs on Dunkin‚Äù is accurate. It is the most popular coffee seller in the country, measured by the number of coffee cups sold. Dunkin Donuts sells over 2 billions cups of coffee in a single calendar year. 

**Why us and not our competitors**? 

As a loyal customer of Dunkin Donuts, I know that Dunkin Donuts produces products of much higher quality at a lower price compared to other companies. Year after year, Dunkin Donuts has not dropped in quality at all. The clientele is very diverse and should provide an opportunity to meet new people and learn new things. This restaurant's target demographic is the working class. These are the people who come here to get a coffee and a sausage egg and cheese sandwich right before work. I take great joy in my genuine desire to make life easier or more convenient for the average American. 

**Why should we hire you**? 

My biggest strength and potential contribution to the company would have to be that I am a team player. In a restaurant staff, it is expected that we, as workers, take care of our own and put the needs of the customers first. Having majored in Behaviour Science in undergrad, I have learned how to get along with people and work as a team. When I did community service for Sacred Heart School in Taftville, I would be assigned a task and expected to do it under a time constraint, as the cafeteria was supposed to be used by someone else for something else at an allotted time. Therefore, I know how to not only do a good job, but complete a job by a strict deadline. Also, I was a student-athlete in high school. From this experience, I built up stamina and learned to multi-task. 

**How would you deal with an unsatisfied customer**? 

I would offer my condolences, ask why the experience was unpleasant and ask what, if anything, I am capable of doing to remedy the situation so that it never occurs again. If it is possible to fulfil the customer‚Äôs request while obeying the rules set in place by my employer, I will do so. 

**Can you work under pressure**? 

I can definitely work under pressure. Pressure makes me a more competent worker. When I completed an internship in undergrad, the knowledge that I had to complete 100 hours of service by the end of the semester gave me the incentive I needed to reach out to people and ask if there were any favours they needed. When my professor told me that failure to complete 100 hours would result in an F for the course and course credit being withheld, I immediately knew that I needed to reach out and seek opportunities as soon as possible. 

**What do you foresee being the biggest challenge at this job**? 

I have always wanted to work here and never given much thought to the challenges that are likely to come up. I imagine I will face the typical challenges associated with a fast paced environment. I am sure that it will be nothing unsolvable. When I face a challenge or I am out of my comfort zone, there is no need to talk about how uncomfortable I am. My discomfort is my problem, no one else‚Äôs. I will deal with the discomfort myself one time. When talking to others I will focus on the positive. 

**What would you do if a customer asked to speak to the manager**? 

I would first ask what the problem is and whether or not I can help. If I can help, I will. If, however, I lack the ability to solve the problem myself or the customer insists on seeing the manager, then I will get the manager immediately. 

**How reliable are you**? 

I pride myself in always showing up and time, doing my best and receiving all the constructive criticism that is useful to me. If I am unable to show up, I intend to give my employer and coworkers notice well in advance. 

**How do you intend to provide excellent customer service**? 

I will always provide service with a smile. In other words, have a positive perky attitude when greeting a customer. I will lead the customer to a seat for an in house order. To ensure that the customer is attended to in a timely manner, I will be sure to sit or stand in a location where I can easily identify a customer and a customer could easily identify me. 

**What would you do if you caught a fellow employee stealing from the cash register**? 

I do not tolerate unethical behaviour such as stealing. I will report the theft in such a way as standard procedure dictates. This is rarely an issue for me in the first place, as the vast majority of people who I have ever met have proper respect for other people‚Äôs property. 

**How do you achieve proper work-life balance**? 

When I am not at work, I throw myself into my hobbies. I enjoy athletic activities like hiking, leisure activities like playing video games and intellectually stimulating activities such as reading classic novels and writing movie reviews. 

**What would you do if a customer ordered in house and refused to pay**? 

I hope I never have to deal with that, but should such an unfortunate circumstance arise, I would speak to security or management, who are trained to handle such situations. 

**What have you done to better your understanding of this field in the last five years**? 

In school, I took several classes in psychology and marketing. This taught me a lot about the economy, customer service, human nature and how to behave professionally. 

**How would you prioritise tasks during a busy period**?

The customer always comes first. 

If I am in the middle of setting a table and a party enters as the phone is ringing, I would drop what I am doing, escort the customer to their table, answer the phone and then finish setting the table in that order. 

**How do you intend to blend with our existing team**? 

I have pretty good communication and people skills. I respect people‚Äôs boundaries. If the employee is more experienced than I am, I will look to him or her for guidance

**Do you have any questions for me**? (This is what the interviewer will ask). 

A year from now, assuming that all goes as planned and I get this job, what will I have to have done to make you glad that you hired me?

I have done landscaping jobs before. I once shovelled snow out of the driveway of a customer who was unable to shovel himself due to back problems. I was self-employed and the pay was not steady. I had to seek out opportunities for work. I did not have the same sense or order that I would have at a job that takes place in a building where I punch in and punch out. That is why I would like a job like this, where I am told when to show up and what to do when I am here. 

I recently finished school. My major was psychology. I knew that the courses that I took in school were no guarantee of figuring out what I wanted to do with my life. However, by understanding human nature, I would be able to better understand the world, which would help me connect with people and figure out how to find work. 

My last semester of undergrad, I worked an unpaid internship on nightly and weekend programming for the Thames program. The Thames program at Mitchell College is a program for students with learning disabilities. I assisted with the prep work, set up and cleaned up for many events. During these events, I would interact with and act as a role model for younger students. As an intern, there was a degree of creativity involved with the job, but for the most part, I followed orders given to me by my supervisor. I foresee this job as one that is mostly about obeying an employer. I intend to set up the place to open and/or clean up the place before leaving after closing. 

**How did you hear about this job**?

I received an email notification from Indeed.com. I like challenges. This job is physically demanding, because you have to lift objects that weigh as much as 35 pounds. The job is also socially challenging, you must greet customers and ensure that people have a pleasant experience when the people in question are complete strangers and you do not know what they like. This job sounds challenging in a good way. This job sounds exactly like a challenging task I have been looking for this whole time. 

**Why do you want to work at this company**? 

I want to work at Dunkin Donuts, because the clientele is very diverse and should provide an opportunity to meet new people and learn new things. 

This restaurant's target demographic is the working class. These are the people who come here to get a coffee and a sausage egg and cheese sandwich right before work. I take great joy in my genuine desire to make life easier or more convenient for the average American. 

**Why should we hire you**? 

My biggest strength and potential contribution to the company would have to be that I am a team player. In a restaurant staff, it is expected that we, as workers, take care of our own and put the needs of the customers first. Having majored in Behaviour Science in undergrad, I have learned how to get along with people and work as a team. When I did community service for Sacred Heart School in Taftville, I would be assigned a task and expected to do it under a time constraint, as the cafeteria was supposed to be used by someone else for something else at an allotted time. Therefore, I know how to not only do a good job, but complete a job by a strict deadline. Also, I was a student-athlete in high school. From this experience, I built up stamina and learned to multi-task. 

**When did you have to work under stress? How did you handle it**?

When I completed an internship in undergrad, I had to complete 100 hours by the end of the semester. I dealt with that stress the same way I dealt with any other form of stress, by using the one year rule. If ever I am stressed about anything, I simply ask myself, will this still be on my mind in a year? If the answer is no, then logically there is no reason to be worried, as it will all blow over in 365 days or less. If, however, the answer is yes, then there is still no reason to be worried, as even if things do not go as planned, there will be plenty more opportunities to rectify what went wrong. I also ask myself this one question. What is the worst thing that can happen? Stress is what you feel when you are not sure what the outcome will be and you know that the outcome could be undesirable. When you take a driving test, you feel stressed, because you might not pass. If you ask yourself what the worst thing that can happen is, you may be surprised to discover that the worst thing that can happen is not only pretty unlikely to happen in the first place, if it were to happen, it would not be that bad. 

**Do you prefer to work alone or as part of a team**? 

I like to work as part of a team. I also enjoy working alone with close supervision. When I did my internship in college, I would interact with my supervisors, the other interns and my teacher. It was all up to me to ensure that I fulfilled my responsibilities. I was supervised in regards to the jobs that I did for the school, but it was my responsibility to ensure that my work was completed in time. 

**How would you deal with a conflict**?

If ever I dealt with a conflict, whether it be work related or inter personal, I would say to the other person the following; 

‚ÄúIt seems to me that you are upset or angry that something has been done wrong. Would you please tell me what I have done wrong, why it was wrong and what, if anything, can be done to improve the situation?‚Äù 

That is verbatim what I would say in response to a complaint.

**How would you remain motivated in your work**?

I consistently ask myself; Am I a better person than I was a year ago? And what do I need to do to become better over the course of the next 365 days? I think of it in terms of years, not days. Everyone has bad days. You don‚Äôt know if you will improve from one day to the next, but there is no excuse for regressing from one year to the next. 

**What is your ideal working environment**?

My ideal working environment is one where everyone makes it a priority to build others up. No one is perfect. When a fellow worker makes a mistake, the appropriate response is to either correct the mistake or teach the person who made the mistake to correct it himself or herself. This expectation should apply in all directions, employee toward employer, employer toward employee and employee toward other employee.  

**Is there anything you have done in the past that you wish you had done differently**? 

When I did community service for Sacred Heart school, I was tasked with vacuuming the carpets. I unplugged the vacuum cleaner before turning it off. I received a shock.  

**If you have a day when you are not busy, what would you do**?

I would ask my supervisor if anything else needs to be done, hoping he or she has a task for me. 

**Why is it important for all policies and standards to be obeyed**?

Policies, procedures and standards are set in place with the intent to work toward a common goal. If some people in a staff or faculty disobey policies, a common goal will never be achieved. 

**When can you start? When are you available**?

I am capable of beginning immediately. I am available to work any shift. 

**Are you able to travel**? 

Although I do not have my own vehicle, I will have transportation for scheduled shifts. 

**Do you have any experience working in fast food**? 

I do not. 

**Why are you interested in working with us**? 

I am a regular customer of Dunkin Donuts. Every product, the donuts, coffee, hot chocolate, and breakfast sandwiches are amazing. I am impressed by the quality of the products, not to mention the customer service. If I work here, I can spread joy through a cup of coffee and make customers loyal to the brand. Furthermore, the fast paced environment is my ideal workplace. 

**What do you know about the company**? 

When William Rosenberg founded Dunkin Donuts in 1950, the company first did business in Quincy Massachusetts. The slogan ‚ÄúAmerica runs on Dunkin‚Äù is accurate. It is the most popular coffee seller in the country, measured by the number of coffee cups sold. Dunkin Donuts sells over 2 billions cups of coffee in a single calendar year. 

**Why us and not our competitors**? 

As a loyal customer of Dunkin Donuts, I know that Dunkin Donuts produces products of much higher quality at a lower price compared to other companies. Year after year, Dunkin Donuts has not dropped in quality at all. The clientele is very diverse and should provide an opportunity to meet new people and learn new things. This restaurant's target demographic is the working class. These are the people who come here to get a coffee and a sausage egg and cheese sandwich right before work. I take great joy in my genuine desire to make life easier or more convenient for the average American. 

**Why should we hire you**? 

My biggest strength and potential contribution to the company would have to be that I am a team player. In a restaurant staff, it is expected that we, as workers, take care of our own and put the needs of the customers first. Having majored in Behaviour Science in undergrad, I have learned how to get along with people and work as a team. When I did community service for Sacred Heart School in Taftville, I would be assigned a task and expected to do it under a time constraint, as the cafeteria was supposed to be used by someone else for something else at an allotted time. Therefore, I know how to not only do a good job, but complete a job by a strict deadline. Also, I was a student-athlete in high school. From this experience, I built up stamina and learned to multi-task. 

**How would you deal with an unsatisfied customer**? 

I would offer my condolences, ask why the experience was unpleasant and ask what, if anything, I am capable of doing to remedy the situation so that it never occurs again. If it is possible to fulfil the customer‚Äôs request while obeying the rules set in place by my employer, I will do so. 

**Can you work under pressure**? 

I can definitely work under pressure. Pressure makes me a more competent worker. When I completed an internship in undergrad, the knowledge that I had to complete 100 hours of service by the end of the semester gave me the incentive I needed to reach out to people and ask if there were any favours they needed. When my professor told me that failure to complete 100 hours would result in an F for the course and course credit being withheld, I immediately knew that I needed to reach out and seek opportunities as soon as possible. 

**What do you foresee being the biggest challenge at this job**? 

I have always wanted to work here and never given much thought to the challenges that are likely to come up. I imagine I will face the typical challenges associated with a fast paced environment. I am sure that it will be nothing unsolvable. When I face a challenge or I am out of my comfort zone, there is no need to talk about how uncomfortable I am. My discomfort is my problem, no one else‚Äôs. I will deal with the discomfort myself one time. When talking to others I will focus on the positive. 

**What would you do if a customer asked to speak to the manager**? 

I would first ask what the problem is and whether or not I can help. If I can help, I will. If, however, I lack the ability to solve the problem myself or the customer insists on seeing the manager, then I will get the manager immediately. 

**How reliable are you**? 

I pride myself in always showing up and time, doing my best and receiving all the constructive criticism that is useful to me. If I am unable to show up, I intend to give my employer and coworkers notice well in advance. 

**How do you intend to provide excellent customer service**? 

I will always provide service with a smile. In other words, have a positive perky attitude when greeting a customer. I will lead the customer to a seat for an in house order. To ensure that the customer is attended to in a timely manner, I will be sure to sit or stand in a location where I can easily identify a customer and a customer could easily identify me. 

**What would you do if you caught a fellow employee stealing from the cash register**? 

I do not tolerate unethical behaviour such as stealing. I will report the theft in such a way as standard procedure dictates. This is rarely an issue for me in the first place, as the vast majority of people who I have ever met have proper respect for other people‚Äôs property. 

**How do you achieve proper work-life balance**? 

When I am not at work, I throw myself into my hobbies. I enjoy athletic activities like hiking, leisure activities like playing video games and intellectually stimulating activities such as reading classic novels and writing movie reviews. 

**What would you do if a customer ordered in house and refused to pay**? 

I hope I never have to deal with that, but should such an unfortunate circumstance arise, I would speak to security or management, who are trained to handle such situations. 

**What have you done to better your understanding of this field in the last five years**? 

In school, I took several classes in psychology and marketing. This taught me a lot about the economy, customer service, human nature and how to behave professionally. 

**How would you prioritise tasks during a busy period**?

The customer always comes first. 

If I am in the middle of setting a table and a party enters as the phone is ringing, I would drop what I am doing, escort the customer to their table, answer the phone and then finish setting the table in that order. 

**How do you intend to blend with our existing team**? 

I have pretty good communication and people skills. I respect people‚Äôs boundaries. If the employee is more experienced than I am, I will look to him or her for guidance

**Do you have any questions for me**? (This is what the interviewer will ask). 

A year from now, assuming that all goes as planned and I get this job, what will I have to have done to make you glad that you hired me? How will I know if I have done a good job?"

267,1,"Hi Dunkin,

I have a Dunkin‚Äô donuts near my place of work, where I pick up ‚Äúcold brews‚Äù 2-5 times a week. I‚Äôm not a huge coffee snob, but I did work at Dunkin in college, and can easily distinguish between cold brew and iced coffee. Dunkin‚Äôs iced coffee is much more bitter, more watered down, a slightly lighter color, and leaves bean dust floating in the bottom of your drink. Cold brew, being around a dollar more, is higher quality and tastes better (imo).

So I guess here‚Äôs where the snobbiness comes in‚Ä¶ I can tell that I often get iced coffee in my ‚Äúcold brew‚Äù, and it quite honestly ruins my day. Some days it‚Äôs just straight undrinkable, or full of bean floaties, or an odd grayish color (presumably because it‚Äôs watered down remaining iced coffee). I‚Äôve tried clarifying that it is cold brew, I‚Äôve tried asking the cashier if they still have cold brew before I order, I‚Äôve even asked the barista which they used. I have never asked for a remake, and I‚Äôm really trying to avoid that, but I will lose my freaking mind if I wind up with another ‚Äúcold brew‚Äù that tastes like coffee piss on ice.

When it comes down to it, if the cashier would honestly tell me that cold brew was out, I simply wouldn‚Äôt buy it that day. I‚Äôm much more a Starbucks gal, but this dunkin is the sole remaining covid survivor in my area. It‚Äôs my only option for coffee I didn‚Äôt make myself. I‚Äôm not trying to be an asshole, I definitely don‚Äôt want to make the employees miserable‚Ä¶.. but how on earth can I get them to be honest with me about the contents of the ‚Äúcold brew‚Äù, and is there any way to avoid a weekly gamble? Is it okay to complain? Is it fine to ask for a remake/ refund? I know I hated remaking drinks, but then again, I took the high road and told my customers when I was out of cold brew‚Ä¶.

Anyway, friendly reminder to all, customers CAN tell the difference when you sub in the cheaper products. If you‚Äôre out of something, please be honest. If you mess up, please correct it. All I want is my cashier to honestly tell me when they‚Äôre out of cold brew - that‚Äôs it.

Any recommendations for drinks that are still sweet and yummy but less calories and don‚Äôt taste fake? Unsweetened flavor shots? Artificial sweeteners? Thanks!"

I even managed to get my life together this morning to be able to leave early enough to stop and get a coffee- which never happens, because I anticipated it being busy today with the release of PS. I ordered a med iced coffee with whole milk, less ice, pumpkin spice and pumpkin cold foam NOT the pumpkin cream cold brew which I saw was made with brown sugar syrup instead of pumpkin. But y'all I'm kind of disappointed. To me it lacked flavor. The best part was the cinnamon sugar sprinkle on top. Am I just being a Karen?

415,1,"This is just me ranting, but I'm losing my mind.

When I first started working at Dunkin, I loved it. There were some hiccups, with me not quite being trained properly, but once I learned everything it was awesome. I liked my coworkers, hell I even liked my manager most days. We all worked well as a team and everything, for the most part, ran smoothly. 

But then our manager quit , and they hired a new manager. Although she claims to have prior experience as a Dunkin manager, I swear to god she has no idea what she's doing. Everyone here welcomed her and tried to help her adjust to the store (our store had been renovated recently so we had a few machines that were different to what she was used to), and she was great.. for a few days.

 I had a week off for a vacation soon after she joined, and when I came back everything had gone to hell. I wish I was exaggerating when I say 75% of my coworkers had already quit, without even a 2 weeks notice. From what I heard over text, she wasn't listening to the hours people said they could work and was scheduling people when they weren't at all available, but then getting mad when they said they couldn't come in. A few times, she left a gap in the schedule where NO ONE WAS SCHEDULED TO BE IN THE STORE. The store, left completely unattended, for SEVERAL HOURS. Machines were breaking because she refused to learn how to use them properly. She'd come on the floor to ""help"", make a mess, and then leave and expect everyone else to clean it up. And in my experience since I've come back, it's all true. I've specifically said I cannot, under any circumstances, work opening shifts. Last week she scheduled me for exclusively opening. I texted her, AGAIN, to tell her I couldn't, and she told me I had to ""figure it out and find someone to cover."" I switched with a girl who said she couldn't do closing shifts and only got closing shifts. 

Now that we're constantly understaffed, we're all just trying our best and, yes, we're taking shortcuts. Shoot me, sometimes I'll make a latte right in the cup instead of putting it in the metal tin first. Or I'll bounce between stations instead of sticking to one because we don't have enough people to staff every station! And when I'm closing I have to leave my coworker out on the floor by herself to go to the back to do closing chores because we don't have anyone else to help. But she is constantly nitpicking everything and saying it's ""not standard!!"" but it's literally the only way we can get through the day anymore.

I came in yesterday, and said Hello to her on my way in. Without even saying hello or good morning or anything, the first thing she said to me, at 6 in the fucking morning, was ""Why did it take you more than 10 minutes to do boxes yesterday?"" It was truck day, I had literally an entire stores worth of supplies that we had unpacked from boxes, and ALL of those boxes had to be broken down. Anyone who works at Dunkin knows that is DOZENS of boxes, and most of them are too big to fit in the dumpster at all so they have to be cut and well broke down before they can be taken out. And that's not including the 2 minutes each way it takes to pull the trashcan to the dumpster, and you usually need at least 2-3 trips (if not more). And I told her all of this, and she said she didn't care, and that next time she caught me ""wasting time"" she'd suspend me.

The only thing keeping me here at this point is that almost no one in the area is hiring, and the very few people that are hiring are hiring for jobs that I am so not qualified for. But I swear I've never felt more mentally drained.",Thinking about Quitting,1660535299,"Thinking about Quitting This is just me ranting, but I'm losing my mind.

From what I heard over text, she wasn't listening to the hours people said they could work and was scheduling people when they weren't at all available, but then getting mad when they said they couldn't come in. A few times, she left a gap in the schedule where NO ONE WAS SCHEDULED TO BE IN THE STORE. The store, left completely unattended, for SEVERAL HOURS. Machines were breaking because she refused to learn how to use them properly. She'd come on the floor to ""help"", make a mess, and then leave and expect everyone else to clean it up. And in my experience since I've come back, it's all true. I've specifically said I cannot, under any circumstances, work opening shifts. Last week she scheduled me for exclusively opening. I texted her, AGAIN, to tell her I couldn't, and she told me I had to ""figure it out and find someone to cover."" I switched with a girl who said she couldn't do closing shifts and only got closing shifts. 

Now that we're constantly understaffed, we're all just trying our best and, yes, we're taking shortcuts. Shoot me, sometimes I'll make a latte right in the cup instead of putting it in the metal tin first. Or I'll bounce between stations instead of sticking to one because we don't have enough people to staff every station! And when I'm closing I have to leave my coworker out on the floor by herself to go to the back to do closing chores because we don't have anyone else to help. But she is constantly nitpicking everything and saying it's ""not standard!!"" but it's literally the only way we can get through the day anymore.

I came in yesterday, and said Hello to her on my way in. Without even saying hello or good morning or anything, the first thing she said to me, at 6 in the fucking morning, was ""Why did it take you more than 10 minutes to do boxes yesterday?"" It was truck day, I had literally an entire stores worth of supplies that we had unpacked from boxes, and ALL of those boxes had to be broken down. Anyone who works at Dunkin knows that is DOZENS of boxes, and most of them are too big to fit in the dumpster at all so they have to be cut and well broke down before they can be taken out. And that's not including the 2 minutes each way it takes to pull the trashcan to the dumpster, and you usually need at least 2-3 trips (if not more). And I told her all of this, and she said she didn't care, and that next time she caught me ""wasting time"" she'd suspend me.

The only thing keeping me here at this point is that almost no one in the area is hiring, and the very few people that are hiring are hiring for jobs that I am so not qualified for. But I swear I've never felt more mentally drained."

456,1,"Hi everyone.  Can someone help me identify and provide a picture of a donut that DD had a longgg time ago in the 90's, but got discontinued?  It was / is my favorite DD item and the best way to describe it is that it was a heavily glazed, dark croissant.  It was brown in color and long; not circular.  The best part about it was that it was so dense and flaky inside and the outer coating of this item could be peeled off to reveal the flaky dough inside.  It's definitely not a french crueller, cronut, glazed stick, original stick, or jelly stick.  I saw a reddit post talking about an 'original crueller' item which may be it, but the frustrating thing is that I can't find any pictures at all online so I'm not sure.

  Hello, I do not make this post to complain but only really for advice. Im scheduled to bake the morning bake by myself on my third day with not a lot of experience. I‚Äôve been told this is very unusual of them to expect this of me. 

I‚Äôve worked there only a total of 10 hours so far besides being shown about half the training videos one day. I think I mostly got the entire bake schedule down because the lady who trained me is great and I am up to the task but there is a lot to it and I technically haven‚Äôt even been there for an entire bake. 

Surely I will bake to the best of my ability but is there anywhere I could watch videos to sort of review for this?

Then I go to make a drink and notice is that the sticker machine is printing the writing HUGE, so only the first few letters of each ingredient are being shown on the sticker. Ex. 1 cre, 2 fre, 4 su instead of 1 cream, 2 French vanilla, 4 sugars. And for frozens it would just say ""(size) frozen"" and we couldn't tell if it was a frozen coffee or frozen hot chocolate. So I had to keep looking on the screen to try and identify what I was making. 


After figuring out what the first drink was I went to put cream in it, only for the dispenser not to shoot anything out (despite at least half full.) I try to use the other machine, same issue. I manually open tiny creamer packets, pour them in, and tell my manager so she knows it's broken.


Next I fill a blender to make a frozen, and pass it off to beverage three for them to blend it. I hear them freaking out, look over, and the machine wouldn't stop dispensing ice. It was supposed to make a small coolata but it has completely filled the blender with ice and was still trying to dispense more. We had to shut down the machine and couldn't do frozens again for the rest of the day.


I got swapped to drivethrough later in the day, and noticed that our drivethrough window wasn't automatically shutting like it was supposed to. This would've been fine, seeing as there wasn't AC or anything so it's not like it could get any hotter, except it was rainy and the wind was blowing all the rain into the store. Had to keep manually pushing/pulling on the window to get it to close and open.


Not only was the rain getting in the store, but it was raining so hard that I was practically screaming into my headset and the people in the drivethrough couldn't hear me still! And then they'd get upset that I wasn't taking their order even though I was trying to, And I had to explain at the window that it was just because of the rain.


Then my manager made me take the trash + all the boxes out. In the rain. On truck day, where I had 5 trash cans worth of boxes + 2 trash cans of actual trash.

Ex. 1 cre, 2 fre, 4 su instead of 1 cream, 2 French vanilla, 4 sugars. And for frozens it would just say ""(size) frozen"" and we couldn't tell if it was a frozen coffee or frozen hot chocolate. So I had to keep looking on the screen to try and identify what I was making. 


After figuring out what the first drink was I went to put cream in it, only for the dispenser not to shoot anything out (despite at least half full.) I try to use the other machine, same issue. I manually open tiny creamer packets, pour them in, and tell my manager so she knows it's broken.


Next I fill a blender to make a frozen, and pass it off to beverage three for them to blend it. I hear them freaking out, look over, and the machine wouldn't stop dispensing ice. It was supposed to make a small coolata but it has completely filled the blender with ice and was still trying to dispense more. We had to shut down the machine and couldn't do frozens again for the rest of the day.


I got swapped to drivethrough later in the day, and noticed that our drivethrough window wasn't automatically shutting like it was supposed to. This would've been fine, seeing as there wasn't AC or anything so it's not like it could get any hotter, except it was rainy and the wind was blowing all the rain into the store. Had to keep manually pushing/pulling on the window to get it to close and open.


Not only was the rain getting in the store, but it was raining so hard that I was practically screaming into my headset and the people in the drivethrough couldn't hear me still! And then they'd get upset that I wasn't taking their order even though I was trying to, And I had to explain at the window that it was just because of the rain.


Then my manager made me take the trash + all the boxes out. In the rain. On truck day, where I had 5 trash cans worth of boxes + 2 trash cans of actual trash.


I've had some bad work days, but this is beyond the worst day I've had. Everything totally went to shit."

We went to Dunkin today because I wanted a coffee since I‚Äôve been up since 5am due to a new medication schedule that ain‚Äôt working for me.

I redeem my free beverage for my drink because why not. We are waiting for our drinks, mine and my stepfathers are finished first, and now we‚Äôre waiting on my mothers.

597,1,"To put it shortly, I was working for a few days during training time, then was put on a 2 day schedule to work 6 hours, then later given 1 day a week of work for 5 to 12, with some days being 6 to 12 and 7 to 12. Then this past month, my boss called and transferred me over to another Dunkin but gave me more hours to work. I worked four days from 5 to 12 under a new manager. But after one week with that crew, the manager realized that she had too many people working on the same shift and needed to send some back. So, she sent me back but didn't tell me even though she said she would give me an update Friday. I found out Sunday of by the district manager that I was sent back and I would get a call from my old manager about the days they will want me to work. 

I got no calls that whole week. I left a message the following Monday and got an answer back on Tuesday that they're putting me on Mondays but are trying to decide what time. I didn't hear anything else the whole week until today that I'm getting Mondays but working only four hours. I might come in this coming Monday but the scheduling has made me consider quitting, maybe after working that Monday. Because it feels like a waste of time. They might be oversaturated with workers since it's the summer and this is popular place to get a summer job, and I don't want to deal with high-stress for that low a pay. Not again.

694,1,"hey, y'all..

this is my first time posting on this subreddit.

anyway, I started working at my very close Dunkins for the past month and a few weeks, and it has been alright. I do overnights and it's just Drive-Thru only until the front doors are unlocked. The plus side is the pay rate and my awesome co-worker. But once 4 AM rolls around, these three guys punch in and are there for the early morning shift. One is a baker, the other is always at sandwich station as the other is there to just open the front doors for Eat In and does the necessary morning shift stuff like temperature records, etc. 

So, I've noticed it is just me (a female) working overnight with my co-worker who's a dude. majority of this Dunks are all men besides my manager and two-morning shift workers. We are always together doing the work and I refuse to leave my ""space"" on the drive-thru area because these early morning shift guys (the 4 AM crew) give me an uncomfortable vibe and I hate the way each of them stares at me when I'm just trying to do my job and I have caught each of them staring at me in a weird way especially when I'm bending over to reach something from the ground level. Almost three weeks ago, the guy who is responsible for being on the front counter and opening up, said to me ""maybe I can help you get better sleep"" with a wink after I complained that I will be tired when I get home and even if I try to sleep, I have two kids under the age of 6 who need my care. When he said that, I felt disgusted and gave him a glare and told him that wasn't cool which he laughed off. Then a week ago and this week, he purposely tried bumping into me so he can feel my ass while I'm making coffee orders in the drive-thru (he's a big average guy but c'mon, there's still space between us but he makes it seem like its cramped). My co-worker has been observant of this behavior ad has told both my manager and me about it and he hates it because all I'm trying to do is my job and I'm already in a committed relationship with kids. My manager has reported these guys and they each have a history of making other (ex) female employees uncomfortable that they either transferred out of the store or quit. My manager has also spoken to this guy but he's back at it with his lewd comments and giving me that off creep vibes. Yesterday after leaving, my co-worker stayed behind to count his register and he heard these guys (including the cleaner and other male crew members) talking about how ""f\*\*\*able"" I look, how my ass looks, etc) and my co-worker snapped at them by \*again\* telling them that I'm 27 and happily taken, and to stop talking about me like that. 

They all laughed at him and kept on with their conversation.

I'm disgusted, repulsed, and don't feel comfortable showing up to work in this kind of environment and I'm sure anyone else will agree. I have vented to my husband about these issues and it has made him very pissed off that before I was ready to clock out this past Sunday, he came to pick me up but went straight to the front counter to ask for my manager and she was there and can see how pissed he was and is aware of the situation that she asked him to follow her to her office and talk to him about this and showed him her reports she has made against these guys. All my manager can say is that if I want, I can call HR/Corporate directly and just make a complaint or threaten them with a harassment lawsuit because she has made numerous complaints and all these guys get is a ""slap on the wrist"" and my manager's boss has already made it clear that they don't want to fire anyone because the Dunks I work at is very short-staffed already..

739,1,"I have to share this with someone because this one customer we always get is.. interesting to say the least.

Apparently she's a regular, but because of my schedule I've never seen her before. However, my availability changed so Ive been working earlier hours, meaning I've started to encounter her.

My first time meeting her was today when I was working drive through. It wasn't super busy and she walked up (yes, walked) to our drivethrough speaker asking for a free water. I said okay, because it's just water and it was a super hot day, and called out to my coworker asking for a medium water. (My stores policy is that we can give away mediums or smalls for free, but larges have to be paid for.) She walks up to the window and I told her like Hey, it's really dangerous to be walking in a drivethrough and could you please just come inside? Our lobby was open, and I was kinda worried a car would pull through and wouldn't see her (our drivethrough has a weird blind spot, which she was standing right in the middle of). She said no and that she needed her water, so I went to go get it quickly before she got hurt. I brought it out to her and told her to have a good day, before walking away from the window to go do something else.

A few seconds later I hear pounding on our drivethrough window. I go back over and she's slamming her fists on the glass, screaming that she wanted a large. I apologized, told her I wasn't allowed to give away larges for free. She reached in my window to dump the medium onto the floor and said ""No, a large."" I went to get my supervisor and hep was just like ""Oh, yeah it's her, just give it to her."" I was just in shock. Gave her a large and she went from hysterical to happy in seconds. Walked back up the drivethrough (towards the speaker, not the exit??) giggling and drinking her water. She yelled ""THANK YOU!"" at the speaker and walked away.

I still don't know how to feel about it to be honest. Everyone else at work has seemingly just accepted it but I'm just like.. why do we let her get away with this?

\- they order 'well done hash browns' as if it's a steak or something. I actually laughed when someone ordered and asked them what they meant, dude says, just put the hash browns in the oven for 2 rotations. I highly doubt that's what he really wanted.  

\- ""let me get a small black iced coffee with 2 shots of x, 2 sugar, and some caramel"" 

\- I had a guy order a black hot coffee with 3 creams, NO SUGAR. gave it to him, he complained it had 3 creams. Same guy proceeds to order again, 2 frozen medium coffees. Give him the first one, buddy loses it and screams that he wanted a small. I told him ok i'll give him a small even though he paid for mediums. 

\- I had someone order 3 sandwhiches, then goes to wait, next person ordered a small coffee and a glaze stick. I give him it. First customer comes over and starts getting in my face about someone else getting served first. I said he didn't order hot food, the customer goes ""well he has the same bag"", I was actually dumbfounded at how stupid you gotta be to say that and think that that is how things work.

\- People really think as I'm making someone's coffee they can order by yelling at me their order. I usually just ignore these tards.

\- People that wait in line and come up to you and go ""i ordered on the app"", like okay.

\- People that come in complain we don't have their mobile order and then I look at their app and tell them they ordered to a different dunkins. Very satisfying especially when they're all worked up over 'our' error. 

\- had a guy scream at me for a blueberry donut, I said I'm too new here to understand where they might be and he points to the cornbread donuts and asks for that one. Not sure if he was happy with the result.

\- Had another guy scream at me after I asked him to confirm he wanted 2 coconut donuts.

\- Had a crazy ass lady that spent her whole day sitting in the dunks ask for the dragonfruit refresher in a cup and ask if it would be free. Like, what.

\- Have multiple idiots that think the tip jar is a 'take a penny' type deal. It's not.

\- People who don't move out of the way after they order when there is a line.

\- Had a dude scream at me ""WHEN AM I GONNA GET MY COFFEE I BEEN WAITIN HERE FOR 5 MINUTES"" during a rush. we are 2 people working, ive been there at that point a week probably.

\- Had another dude get his croissant wrong it was chocolate not plain and he lost his mind and walked out yelling FUCK THIS instead of waiting for a plain one to be heated, literally does not take even a minute. 

\- People that are rude / yell at you then come back in and pretend it never happened, naw ur service is gonna be slow as hell and I'm going to be rude back to you. 

\- some of these peoples coffee orders are legitimately disgusting and sometimes half the cup is full of flavoring shit, like u see the posts on here all the time about nasty coffee orders, it's true and a good chunk of the time it's ordered on ubereats/grubhub/doordash.

\- had a guy scream at me for a blueberry donut, I said I'm too new here to understand where they might be and he points to the cornbread donuts and asks for that one. Not sure if he was happy with the result.

\- Had another guy scream at me after I asked him to confirm he wanted 2 coconut donuts.

\- Had a crazy ass lady that spent her whole day sitting in the dunks ask for the dragonfruit refresher in a cup and ask if it would be free. Like, what.

\- Have multiple idiots that think the tip jar is a 'take a penny' type deal. It's not.

\- People who don't move out of the way after they order when there is a line.

\- Had a dude scream at me ""WHEN AM I GONNA GET MY COFFEE I BEEN WAITIN HERE FOR 5 MINUTES"" during a rush. we are 2 people working, ive been there at that point a week probably.

\- Had another dude get his croissant wrong it was chocolate not plain and he lost his mind and walked out yelling FUCK THIS instead of waiting for a plain one to be heated, literally does not take even a minute. 

\- People that are rude / yell at you then come back in and pretend it never happened, naw ur service is gonna be slow as hell and I'm going to be rude back to you. 

\- some of these peoples coffee orders are legitimately disgusting and sometimes half the cup is full of flavoring shit, like u see the posts on here all the time about nasty coffee orders, it's true and a good chunk of the time it's ordered on ubereats/grubhub/doordash.

\- people talk to you like ur a computer, I understand the hey how's it going , may be a bit annoying but if u walk up to me and just go ""medium hot coffee black"" im gonna be a little annoyed , 99% of the time these people are boomers."

831,1,"here are some things i‚Äôve noticed that bug workers and customers alike 

1) if you are ordering a dozen donuts and you want to pick them out dear god do NOT do it through the drive thru. come in. also donuts typically sell out by 1pm so if you come at 5 and ask for a dozen you will probably be let down.

2) if you want cream or sugar please say that. if you want a specific amount, tell the person. so many times people assume the employees just know their order and know how they take their coffee and then get mad when it doesn‚Äôt come out the way they wanted. also- we don‚Äôt mind re making drinks at all.

3) if you say you want a medium black coffee with caramel in it- then it‚Äôs no longer a black coffee because the swirls have milk built in. 

4) if you place your mobile order a minute before you come it won‚Äôt be ready. and if you place it and come thru an hour later everything will be melted. my best advice is to place it before leaving your house so it will be ready when you come.

5) if you have two separate orders please tell the person at the window instead of just starting at them and not leaving the drive thru. sometimes it‚Äôs so busy the order taker doesn‚Äôt have time to notify the cashier that someone has two separate orders and people will just sit in their cars looking into space for 5 minutes instead of telling you they had a second order. 

6) if you pay in all change i will personally take 10 minutes to count it and hand your food out, i get if it was a $2 bill but if you give me $8 worth of dimes and nickels and are rude about it (most times) then i will take my sweet old time doing it. 

7) MOST IMPORTANT- we are just people like you we are just doing our jobs and it‚Äôs just coffee. if it is wrong, ask nicely and it will be remade. so many people treat food workers as personal servants and get mad when they aren‚Äôt catered to during a rush where everyone is doing 5 things at once. be patient and nice and appreciate that it‚Äôs just coffee and mess ups can be fixed :) i can tell you that the regular customers we are rude are very well known and all the employees know who is rude and who isn‚Äôt before they even come up to the window. and the regular customers who are sweet bulls relationships and we are happy to see them!",tips for customers,1657542336,"tips for customers here are some things i‚Äôve noticed that bug workers and customers alike

2) cold brew with brown sugar cold foam: this drink is only cold brew with foam on top and no syrup by default.

I place his mobile orders for him through the app every time he needs it which is often. 
I am placing these orders 10-15 minutes before he arrives at the locations. Why? Because the food part of the order is only ready half of the time.

Weve never been offered refunds, never even really complained to the workers because we arent the confrontational kind. At this point Im just irritated for my husband. He doesnt have time to get in line and wait after finding out his food isnt ready for 10 mins. Hence why we use mobile ordering in the first place. So he can walk in, get his stuff, walk out. For months they just...never gave him the donuts he ordered. Now its whatever food he gets. The drinks the only thing present. 
I wish I had a record of how often this happens. It sounds ridiculous but we've been doing this for over a year, and i want to say at least 30-40% of the time he walks out without breakfast and is upset, to say the least.

Eggs and hash browns for example can pass the protection sheet and touch the bacon grease If not cleaned properly Busy days were just inna hurry so deep cleaning them isn't done untill closing. But dam we go through alot of bacon lol.

1177,1,"Okay, so this has been bugging me for the past few hours ever since I ended my shift today at work. So, I work at the local Dunkin's in my town and the day was mostly good. One of my better workdays even. I'm new and have only been there for a month and a half by now. Today, during one of the last hours of my shift, I was trying to fix the donut case. It was almost noon and there were two empty spaces at the top that I wanted to fill with two single trays of donuts that were at the bottom so I could cover the last shelf with the blinds once it was empty. 

This girl who I just met last week starts coming over while I am thinking about putting them next to the big trays of donuts and is like ""You probably can just leave the space empty because I'm going to move the muffins over there."" Now the muffins are perfectly placed at the top and usually sitting there in the other case because they're supposed to be. Not to mention there is a full single tray of each muffin next to each other. The second case was looking nice. There were cases with single donuts, and I would gladly move them to a different tray that has space, but sometimes the manager tells me to leave them in their own tray, so we don't confuse the customers. Plus there were plenty of donuts in other trays, and spaces between the trays at the top that needed to be filled and they would perfectly be there, if I just placed some in the middle at the top and fill any empty spaces with some donut trays at the bottom, like my supervisor usually tells me to do. 

I don't know if this girl is returning employee or new, she might have been the former, but I was a little confused when she told me that she was going to transfer the muffins there. I mean, I've seen other co-workers just do what I was initially going to do. When I told her what I was about to do, she was like ""I'm just telling you this because I'm closing and am going to put the muffins over on this case instead"". I told her I was just putting some on there for now so there wouldn't be empty gaps because I know our boss doesn't like that, and I placed a tray of Boston Kreme at the top to fill a gap. She just said ""Okay, you can do that for now,"" but then I saw her walk over to two of our other co-workers who were just standing there by drive-thru looking at us, and she looks like she was saying something to them, and then the other co-worker she was talking to said ""Yeah, that's how everyone else feels,"" while she was looking right at me. And I was like ""Are they talking about me?"" 

Like, what does ""everyone \[supposedly\] feel""? Because I wasn't trying to be a jerk or know-it-all. I know I'm new I was just trying to follow what I was usually told, especially since I had tried to put different pastries on certain trays and told to ""keep some in their own trays instead and focus on filling the gaps"". Plus, I still had chores to finish before my shift ends and fixing the donut case is one of them, so I didn't want to just stand there and do nothing. I immediately asked  the other two co-workers if I had made a mistake and explained what I was trying to do. They told me  that they might move stuff over soon, so I was like ""Okay"". 

I then told the girl that I'm just ""leaving some trays up there to fill in the gaps for now"" because I didn't want to leave the case looking incomplete like that. Then she was like ""Okay, it's just that I have a certain way of doing things when organizing the cases."" And I was like ""Okay, I understand."" I was like, 'alright, I'll leave it to her. She probably is just a returning employee and have done this many times already. It's whatever. My only issue is that fact that it seems like she was talking about me or what I was doing to the other co-workers and one of them was making a passive-aggressive comment while looking in my direction. I didn't know exactly what the girl whispered to her, but with what she did immediately after what I said I was trying to do, it seems like this is what happened. 

You could easily guess what the subject of their mini-chat was about at that point. And I'm thinking ""Okay. I'm not trying to step on anyone's toes. I'm just trying to do my job. If this girl has something to say, she can say it to my face instead of being a fake b\*tch and trying to say something behind my back as if I wouldn't notice. As for the other co-worker, she's said some mild condescending shit before (did on my second day of work, if you remember my post about that), but she's usually upfront with me on some stuff if I've made a mistake. I don't need that passive-aggressive nonsense just because I wanted to just fill the remaining gaps on a donut case. You know? Like, I don't have time for that toxic BS. It's rude and petty. Like, if I was making a mistake here by not letting her do it before my shift ends or something, my bad, but it does not warrant that behavior. Not to mention the fact that they seemed a bit standoffish when I was clocking out for work annoyed me, too. Like, it's not that deep.

1280,1,"Every once in awhile I come across a beverage that makes me want to have one almost daily, and Dunkin‚Äôs Salted Caramel Cold Brew happens to be that drink! However I‚Äôve only been able to find it a non-local DD which of course I always happen to visit when I‚Äôm in the area. The salted caramel syrup mixed with SC cold foam and topped with cinnamon sugar is quite delightful. However it seems that the drink is no longer available after having asked for it several local Dunkins. My guess is that the location which had it was probably using some leftover supply. 

So just curious if anyone knows the future of this drink, and of any potential alternatives..?

If one more customer screams hello in my ear on the headset ü•≤. Most of the time there's only three of us and we're moving as fast as we can. Please don't pull up and automatically scream ""hello?!"", there's a ding to inform us you're there.

Oh, and if you pull to the window without being told to I'm making you pull back to the speaker to wait again. Usually my gm will hop on the headset and yell back at the customer to wait a moment ...they usually drive off (not surprising). I usually try to politely tell them one moment before he gets the chance to ""politely"" tell them...but if you start saying things like ""how long"", I let him do his bidding. I only work Dunkin one day a week now and I think about how I kind of miss it until customers do stuff like this constantly because we're understaffed. My gm can be rough around the edges but at least he doesn't let customers walk all over us. A customer was once talking rudely to me barking demands and he legitimately walked over to the window and said "" say please"". The customer actually said please and stopped being rude. I don't think some customers even know they're being rude. Most days I just suck it up but some days I just straight up call him to the window to put up with it. You get three strikes before I call him to the window. They usually ask for gm after he goes over there but to there surprise he is the gm.

If one more customer screams hello in my ear on the headset ü•≤. Most of the time there's only three of us and we're moving as fast as we can. Please don't pull up and automatically scream ""hello?!"", there's a ding to inform us you're there. Sometimes we take a minute to come on to the mic because we're assisting a customer at the window or making someone elses food/drink. Please be patient. Oh, and if you pull to the window without being told to I'm making you pull back to the speaker to wait again. Usually my gm will hop on the headset and yell back at the customer to wait a moment ...they usually drive off (not surprising). I usually try to politely tell them one moment before he gets the chance to ""politely"" tell them...but if you start saying things like ""how long"", I let him do his bidding. I only work Dunkin one day a week now and I think about how I kind of miss it until customers do stuff like this constantly because we're understaffed. My gm can be rough around the edges but at least he doesn't let customers walk all over us. A customer was once talking rudely to me barking demands and he legitimately walked over to the window and said "" say please"". The customer actually said please and stopped being rude. I don't think some customers even know they're being rude. Most days I just suck it up but some days I just straight up call him to the window to put up with it. You get three strikes before I call him to the window. They usually ask for gm after he goes over there but to there surprise he is the gm. They usually just cuss me out after ( even though I wasn't the one who did anything ü•≤) and drive off. Again, he's a little rough around the edges but at least he doesn't let us be punching bags."

I got to work at around 3:25PM after having a panic attack over missing part of my uniform and overall having a bad day AND being late. I clock in, put my stuff away and go to the front. 

there‚Äôs a lady standing at the donut racks looking irritated, she looked at me and and said ‚Äúwe‚Äôll are you going to help me?‚Äù and i politely said ‚Äúsure if you come over to the cash register i can get your order started‚Äù 

she comes over and starts her order, 18 munchkins and 2 custard filled donuts. After confirming with my co worker, i tell her we don‚Äôt have any more. She IMMEDIATELY cops an attitude, saying how ridiculous it is we don‚Äôt have donuts. I just kind of sit there until she decided on a new donut, she wanted Bismarck, again, we‚Äôre out of that. At that point she throws her hands down and says ‚Äúfine i don‚Äôt want any of it. i want a refund.‚Äù so i put the munchkins and donuts away. 

i‚Äôve never done a refund before, ever, so i try to ask one of the older girls, who tells me to text the manager. I text the manger who, is no help. So i figure it out myself after sitting there for 20 mins trying to figure it out, about half way through she asked to speak to a manager and my manager wasn‚Äôt there and she responded with ‚Äúso they‚Äôre having people who are useless and worthless at their job working with out a manager? wow‚Äù at this point im trying not to cry, im shaking violently, i haven‚Äôt eaten or drank at all at this point, im tired and not having a good day. 

I sit there and i don‚Äôt say anything and i figure it out and accidentally refunded for 14 munchkins and the two donuts instead of 18 munchkins so literally $1.05 was missing. She, once again, called me useless at my job and she wanted the managers number who was ignoring me now. She was yelling at me and i genuinely thought it was the system because i double checked and thought everything was okay, luckily at this point my managers boss came in and helped her, the lady switched her attitude with her and wasn‚Äôt rude at all while i was sitting there trying not to break down sobbing in the middle of the lobby. 

Once my managers boss left i immediately went to the freezer and sobbed for a good 5 minutes. Luckily i had awesome customers the rest of the day :)

I hate seeing articles like this because it really just shows that people don't understand how menus work. You can get any flavor in a coffee. A caramel cold brew is not a different menu item from a normal cold brew. That's why they separate the flavors from the drinks on the menu.

What makes it even worse is stuff like the final entry ""caramel cold foam cold brew,"" where they say they don't know if it's the same caramel that goes in the foam as that which goes in the drink. Like, no, the foam comes from a can and the caramel swirl is a syrup.

I ordered a ""medium iced cake batter latte with whole milk""

They gave me a medium iced *coffee* (cake batter) with oat milk. Okay no problem, people make mistakes. Another barista remade it.

Except this time she put a large iced cake batter signature latte on the counter. I asked whose it was. I thought maybe someone else ordered a cake batter signature latte *because I sure as hell didn't*. The barista said, ""this is what you ordered"". I said no I didn't. 

She upgraded me to a large signature because of their earlier mistake, which is my guess. Which is fine.

Anyway, I didn't ask them to remake it, said thank you and walked away. I think if you're going to upgrade someone's drink, ask them first: ""Would you like me to upgrade your drink to a large signature as a courtesy?"" 

Taste test: initial sip I get a massive sugar alcohol taste. It reminds me of old-school starbucks french vanilla Frappuccino's. I honestly don't taste cake batter. Just tastes like heavy french vanilla+alcohol. It's not the worst swirl I've tried. But I can't say that I am a fan. I definitely prefer the butter pecan now that I've tried both. With butter pecan I can still taste the espresso. Whereas with this one I don't taste coffee at all. It just tastes like sugar alcohol.

Taste test: initial sip I get a massive sugar alcohol taste. It reminds me of old-school starbucks french vanilla Frappuccino's. I honestly don't taste cake batter. Just tastes like heavy french vanilla+alcohol. It's not the worst swirl I've tried. But I can't say that I am a fan. I definitely prefer the butter pecan now that I've tried both. With butter pecan I can still taste the espresso. Whereas with this one I don't taste coffee at all. It just tastes like sugar alcohol. So yeah, looks like this is a dud for me and I probably won't buy it again. #BringBackSaltedCaramel"

My current manager has been working at DD SINCE 2000 and interviewed me for 45 mins. She told me this location used to be really rough and the old owner ""left""  and a whole new crew came in including her. 

I then went and trained at another location to watch DU videos with a very nice HR lady. Everything seems to be going well but I'm worried about moving too slow or making too many mistakes or getting yelled at by massholes. Normal people can handle this but cue PTSD and high functioning autism. 

I think maybe a lot of people who work food service, could be similar to me. How do you handle it? I used to be a waitress for years and I honestly don't remember how I did it. Sorry if this is really long!!!

I have PTSD, ADHD, Borderline, and autism. And, one of my Mexicans has terrible side effects like making me forget things. I have to take Adderall, drink tons of coffee, hit my vape constantly, smoke weed and take kratom to feel and act  normal. 

I'm actually overqualified to work here, but I want to work here because I don't have enough self esteem to work at the type of job I studied for and I don't want to sit in an office all day right now.

Nothing wrong with working at Dunkin, I eat here every day!

1793,1,"Hello, I am a dunkin employee, and during the pre-February window, i made a little post where i went through each of the new items before they were widely known, and I missed the valentines/March one, so I guess I'll do it now. Since there's only three new items, (somehow, lemonade is already on backorder... geez.) I'll also give some personal drink recommendations and a weird story.

&amp;#x200B;

Cake Batter Swirl (in a small iced coffee, cream only): Okay, this is the one I was looking forward to the most. I love cake batter flavored things, and this was pretty great. For some reason, when pumping it it comes out thin so ask for a little extra. It's sweet, but when trying to mix swirls together it gets muddied up by the other flavors. 8/10

Butter Pecan (in a small iced coffee, cream only): When I got hired last September, we still had some and god, there is definitely a reason why everyone loves it. It's sweet, nutty, everything great. I don't care if the ice cream market looks at it as a geezer flavor, it's a 10/10!

Mango Pineapple Refresher (sample cup of pure concentrate): Okay not gonna lie, it's underwhelming. It just tastes pineappley with not much other substance to it. My mistake for doing that. 4/10 

Mango Pineapple Refresher (Green Tea): The green tea brings something out of it at least, giving it some depth besides fruitiness. 6/10.

Mango Pineapple Refresher (Coconutmilk): I'm sorry, but if I'm going to try this, I need an ambulance crew on standby. A little coconut is fine, but having a drink being half-coconut milk would probably kill me

&amp;#x200B;

Now we're in the weird stuff

Strawberry Shortcake 2.0: Ask for a vanilla bean coolata with 2 pumps strawbery and a non-cautious amount of cake batter. If you thought the vanilla bean + strawberry on it's own was great, try that.

""Illegal"" Lemonade Refreshers: If your dunkin has bottled lemonade, ask for any of the refreshers with just concentrate and room in the cup. Put the lemonade in. This has been my go to drink for the past few weeks.

Butter Pecan Hot Chocolate: As simple as it says. Butter pecan swirl, hot chocolate. Good stuff, even despite the tummy trouble because coconut oil in the hot choc

Plain Yeast Donut: So... our baker called out 2 days ago so we had way too much stock. Out of curiosity, I bit into one of the plain, unfrosted yeast rings and... EUGH! It's floury and salty with nothing really redeeming to it. It's like scraping the underside of 20 English muffins and not toasting them.

2003,1,"TL/DR: I'm an overwhelmed employee who used to really enjoy my job but now my work is draining me more and more and I feel torn. 

I'm getting to that point where I want to quit for real this time. I'm the main Baker, and during the golden age of my employment as I call it (last spring/early summer) I really loved my job. I made a lot of friends and work didn't feel like work. 

But in the fall of last year, things got pretty blah and now things are just getting bad. We got bought out by a big company and they're making so many changes, like the dress code. We're even changing how the donut case is organized and specific kinds of donuts go into assorted dozens now, which led to us running out of blueberry at like 7am. And I love the way I organized my donuts and I don't want to be told what to do in the one thing where I felt like I had creative freedom... Corporate obviously doesn't listen to what we feel is best and what works for our individual store. 

Worst part, there's literally so much drama lately! I almost walked out today because my coworkers are like going at each other's throats. I'm going to feel bad if I end up leaving because I know how hard it is to find a Baker. But this place has been sucking the life out of me for the past year and a half overall and I can't anymore. This isn't even to mention how the customers in the town that I work can be so mean and racist as well. We've had sandwiches thrown at us, direct threats, and some people have used terrible derogatory terms that I won't repeat here. All have been banned by our store, but similar people eventually take their place. The kind people get fewer and far between no matter how nice I am to them. All of it makes me dread coming in to work. 

I miss our old manager, but our newer manager is awesome and I know he's trying his best and he's doing well. I don't want to let him down. But I just can't do the drama anymore or the early mornings or people yelling at me. It's getting real bad for my mental health. I would be sad to leave but maybe it really is time.

Full disclosure, I've never been to Dunkin Donuts before today.

I'd heard of DD and seen some commercials, but never actually been to one myself.

One iced coffee with 10 creams 4 sugars, and a side of mini hashbrowns. 

Here's where it gets prickly, at the end, she mentioned she wanted an order of ""Dumpy Dunks"". When I asked her what those were she said they were similar to donut holes. When I pulled up to the drive-through window to place the order, everything went smooth until I couldn't find ""Dumpy Dunks"" anywhere on the menu. I asked the person taking my order if they had been discontinued and after a while of pausing he said he didn't remember that product ever being sold in store (he also mentioned that he was new).

2375,1,"So it seems like four out of five times that I ask for flavor shots instead of swirls (which is always), I get my cup and look at the tag on the side to see ""Swirls"" listed despite asking for Shots. This is at multiple different Dunkins throughout the state. I am on a very low-sugar diet, so it's basically a wasted coffee for me at that point unless I inevitably give it to someone else. However, what boggled my mind was a few hours ago when this happened to me I made my order (iced coffee, stevia, oat milk, 4 french vanilla flavor shots) and was asked to confirm if I meant ""unsweetened french vanilla"".   


I was under the impression that all of the flavor shots were ""unsweetened"" so I said yes. Couldn't go wrong that way, right? Got my coffee and it had 4 Swirls listed on the tag.  


Am I doing something wrong in ordering?

2545,0,"This month I quit my job at arguably the most successful coffee chain company, which I once embraced and fully loved. I worked there for just over 3.5 years. While there are multiple reasons that I decided to leave, I wanted to share my experience with reporting sexual harassment.


In February of 2021, two years into my employment at this company. A shift supervisor transferred to the store where I had worked since it opened. He ended up sexually harassing not only me but multiple female employees, including minors.

For a few months, I was in denial about the misconduct. However, many of my co-workers pointed out the ""special interest"" the shift supervisor had taken with me. Once it was shared with me that he had said borderline predatory comments to minors at my store, I decided enough was enough.

Initially, I was hesitant to speak out about the harassment because I knew the district manager, Dave Schuberth, favored him. They had weekly meetings about potentially making him an ASM.


I drafted a document outlining the harassment. I had close to fifteen of my fellow baristas who either experienced harassment or witnessed it sign their names. I presented it to my store manager, who then escalated it to Dave.

Bare minimum, I asked that this shift supervisor be transferred to another store, as he already covered shifts at other stores. I was told that it couldn't happen because it would be a form of retaliation against him.

From that point on, there was a corporate investigation for months. I continued working at the store, as did my harasser, our store manager scheduled us at different times to prevent overlap. Still, he would show up to work early or stay late due to understaffing, and he always ended up in my proximity. I often would have panic attacks before going into the store if I saw his car in the parking lot.

Weeks go by, and he makes a ""joke"" about ""punching me in the fucking face"" in front of another worker, and Dave suspends him.

Ultimately, I don't know the details of what happened post-suspension. I did receive a call saying my claims were found to be substantiated, but I wasn't told what that meant going forward. By late June 2021, he was no longer employed by the company. I found out when a barista told me he was seen dropping off his store key.

In October of 2021, I was told by a reputable source from another store that not only does this former shift supervisor frequent this store, he asked to be re-hired. I was under the impression that he was banned from the stores because I have seen bans implemented for much less.

Come December of 2021, while I'm working, the former supervisor comes in to pick up his tips and sees me and vice versa. My body immediately goes into fight or flight, and my co-workers are just as shocked. Essentially, I had a panic attack, started crying, and told my manager I was going home because I didn't feel safe.

Two months prior, I stepped down from the shift supervisor role because the stress negatively impacted me. On my last day as a shift supervisor, I was verbally and almost physically assaulted by a man in the cafe. I filed an incident report and texted my manager, and I had no choice but to finish my shift in tears. No one in management ever followed up with me about the assault. 

In January of 2022, I asked to set up a time to speak with my store manager and Dave about my concerns. Dave never gave me a solid time and ambushed me during my shift. We ended up having this conversation in the BOH, where other employees overheard, even though I said I wasn't prepared to have that conversation.

I talked about how my mental health was negatively impacted and how I wasn't happy about how the situation was handled. I said it didn't make sense to me that a former shift supervisor was able to come into the store that he was fired from for sexual misconduct. Dave told me he wasn't fired for those reasons but did not disclose why he was terminated. I also mentioned that management never followed up with me about my sexual harassment claim or the man in the cafe who assaulted me. Dave was adamant that he followed up with me because he ""had it in his calendar.""

Dave said he couldn't ban the former shift supervisor because ""if we ban him from this store, we have to ban him from all the stores."" He said it could be cause for him to retaliate. Funny how every time I asked for measures to be exercised to protect me from this individual, it's considered to be retaliation. Dave told me I could present a restraining order to enact a ban. I then was gaslit for the duration of the conversation and told to ""trust the system.""

I wasn't necessarily shocked by his lack of accountability. In March of 2020, during the onset of COVID-19, I was working a shift, and we ran out of hot water. Dave advised us to mix boiling water from the brewer with cold water and hand soap into a container we put iced coffee in to wash our hands. He told us to tell customers we couldn't serve food because ""the ovens were broken.""

Not only is Dave a sexual predator sympathizer, but he's also a liar and prioritizes sales over workers' best interests. He's the dirty car salesman of coffee.


Ultimately, I decided the job was destructive to my mental health. I made a grueling decision to quit, forfeiting two years left of my SCAP scholarship with ASU. I am now anticipating at-least three months of no health insurance as I wait for enrollment at my new job.
I started at 18 years old, trained over 15 baristas, opened two stores, built a rapport throughout the district, and was promoted to shift supervisor. I gave my literal blood, sweat, and tears to this place but was still treated poorly by management. This country has always upheld the reputations of predators, so at the time, it was very jarring to me that this progressive and value-driven company was no different.

Still, he would show up to work early or stay late due to understaffing, and he always ended up in my proximity. I often would have panic attacks before going into the store if I saw his car in the parking lot.

Weeks go by, and he makes a ""joke"" about ""punching me in the fucking face"" in front of another worker, and Dave suspends him.

Ultimately, I don't know the details of what happened post-suspension. I did receive a call saying my claims were found to be substantiated, but I wasn't told what that meant going forward. By late June 2021, he was no longer employed by the company. I found out when a barista told me he was seen dropping off his store key.

In October of 2021, I was told by a reputable source from another store that not only does this former shift supervisor frequent this store, he asked to be re-hired. I was under the impression that he was banned from the stores because I have seen bans implemented for much less.

Come December of 2021, while I'm working, the former supervisor comes in to pick up his tips and sees me and vice versa. My body immediately goes into fight or flight, and my co-workers are just as shocked. Essentially, I had a panic attack, started crying, and told my manager I was going home because I didn't feel safe.

Two months prior, I stepped down from the shift supervisor role because the stress negatively impacted me. On my last day as a shift supervisor, I was verbally and almost physically assaulted by a man in the cafe. I filed an incident report and texted my manager, and I had no choice but to finish my shift in tears. No one in management ever followed up with me about the assault. 

In January of 2022, I asked to set up a time to speak with my store manager and Dave about my concerns. Dave never gave me a solid time and ambushed me during my shift. We ended up having this conversation in the BOH, where other employees overheard, even though I said I wasn't prepared to have that conversation.

I talked about how my mental health was negatively impacted and how I wasn't happy about how the situation was handled. I said it didn't make sense to me that a former shift supervisor was able to come into the store that he was fired from for sexual misconduct. Dave told me he wasn't fired for those reasons but did not disclose why he was terminated. I also mentioned that management never followed up with me about my sexual harassment claim or the man in the cafe who assaulted me. Dave was adamant that he followed up with me because he ""had it in his calendar.""

Dave said he couldn't ban the former shift supervisor because ""if we ban him from this store, we have to ban him from all the stores."" He said it could be cause for him to retaliate. Funny how every time I asked for measures to be exercised to protect me from this individual, it's considered to be retaliation. Dave told me I could present a restraining order to enact a ban. I then was gaslit for the duration of the conversation and told to ""trust the system.""

I wasn't necessarily shocked by his lack of accountability. In March of 2020, during the onset of COVID-19, I was working a shift, and we ran out of hot water. Dave advised us to mix boiling water from the brewer with cold water and hand soap into a container we put iced coffee in to wash our hands. He told us to tell customers we couldn't serve food because ""the ovens were broken.""

Not only is Dave a sexual predator sympathizer, but he's also a liar and prioritizes sales over workers' best interests. He's the dirty car salesman of coffee.


Ultimately, I decided the job was destructive to my mental health. I made a grueling decision to quit, forfeiting two years left of my SCAP scholarship with ASU. I am now anticipating at-least three months of no health insurance as I wait for enrollment at my new job.
I started at 18 years old, trained over 15 baristas, opened two stores, built a rapport throughout the district, and was promoted to shift supervisor. I gave my literal blood, sweat, and tears to this place but was still treated poorly by management. This country has always upheld the reputations of predators, so at the time, it was very jarring to me that this progressive and value-driven company was no different.
To Dave, I genuinely fear what kind of precedent you're setting as a father in your home, and I hope you're dealt with accordingly."

2570,0,"Hello Starbucks Reddit. Today I come with a major concern I've had ever since I started working at my college campus's store. So I started working at Starbucks in the summer, but bc of my class schedule and lack of transportation (I have to share the car with my mom and we almost always had the same shifts so it would be either one of us driving and the other taking a lyft, most of my shifts were midday so I couldn't take advantage of the free rides). Anyway. I had to quit to apply to my store on campus, and I honestly didn't want to, I loved my manager and everyone there.

I just started this past Monday, and... I don't want to sound like I'm a know-it-all but that store is so DISORGANIZED. There's a shift supervisor in training who doesn't know how to make Fraps and the rest of the closing shift she's just wiping the counters. There's no fixed positions. I thought it would be different when I came yesterday for the midday. There was no shift supervisor, my coworkers just said I do ""what's available"". So I went on the register. Mind you, I was pretty quick with all the orders and that usual long ass line of 20+ people was now 5 people waiting to get their order in. However, there were people waiting 10+ minutes to get their order, and I feel really bad bc the drinks are not standard made. To give you an example: they put the refreshers directly in the cup, no shaking, no nothing, NADA. And since our customers are college students they gotta take whatever bs they're served bc they got class or are in a rush to somewhere and can't bother stay longer to complain bc it already takes too long to get a matcha latte üóø

Listen, correct me if I'm wrong, but for refreshers you put all the contents in the shaker, and shake. Not put the stuff in the cup then put it in the shaker (which they did... sometimes, very few times actually). Another thing... they don't sequence. People saw me deliver 3 drinks at once, they were giving drinks 1 at a time... üóø so no wonder why people always complain that the line takes too long. 

Next, the closing shift on Monday was too long. We should have been able to have everything clean by 10/10:30, just ring some last orders and close at 11. But because no one is delegated any task, people just do what they think they should do. No one has done the cabinets, and yesterday I felt bad bc one of the supervisors (for the food stations on campus) came to order some drinks and pointed out that our registers were dusty... Tell me how we got 4+ baristaa doing drinks and we still have a long ass line (we don't even have a drive thru, thank God bc with how things are run, that would be my 13th reason). The manager knew I had worked for Starbucks in the summer, and it feels like I'm the most experienced in that store (but to put it into perspective I've only worked at Starbucks for 2 months, some of thess people have been working at the campus store for years... I'm trying to meet with the manager and express my concerns but before I do I want to make sure I am in the right here, and if you could advice me how to go over these issues without it sounding like ""I know better, I should run the store"" bc no, I don't know better, I'm just doing  part time, and I won't offer to be a shift supervisor bc I know that takes training and weekly meetings which I would probably not be able to go to with how packed my schedule is (I'm studying to be a teacher and I have to do in-person observations for my courses, add the clubs I'm in, and the other classes, I barely make time to work and study). 

There is a lot of other stuff too I could mention, like how everyone leaves the milks outside the fridge and without the cap... I'm not joking, I've had to ask for 2% milk 10+ times during each shift I've been so far. Bc they keep moving it around, because no one restocks until were fully out of the last bottle of milk... like I said, I'm honestly really stressed by this situation and I wonder what I can do or what the manager can do to fix this. Idk what the training is for the new S.S. but she doesn't even know her Fraps, she's very sweet with me, and again none of this is personal but I can't just put a blind eye to the fact that this store is running by the grace of God or smth bc if it was an actual store I bet Karens would have drowned it and put it to rest.",Venti rant about my (college campus) store,1663166075,"Venti rant about my (college campus) store Hello Starbucks Reddit.

However, there were people waiting 10+ minutes to get their order, and I feel really bad bc the drinks are not standard made. To give you an example: they put the refreshers directly in the cup, no shaking, no nothing, NADA. And since our customers are college students they gotta take whatever bs they're served bc they got class or are in a rush to somewhere and can't bother stay longer to complain bc it already takes too long to get a matcha latte üóø

Listen, correct me if I'm wrong, but for refreshers you put all the contents in the shaker, and shake. Not put the stuff in the cup then put it in the shaker (which they did... sometimes, very few times actually). Another thing... they don't sequence. People saw me deliver 3 drinks at once, they were giving drinks 1 at a time... üóø so no wonder why people always complain that the line takes too long. 

Next, the closing shift on Monday was too long. We should have been able to have everything clean by 10/10:30, just ring some last orders and close at 11. But because no one is delegated any task, people just do what they think they should do. No one has done the cabinets, and yesterday I felt bad bc one of the supervisors (for the food stations on campus) came to order some drinks and pointed out that our registers were dusty... Tell me how we got 4+ baristaa doing drinks and we still have a long ass line (we don't even have a drive thru, thank God bc with how things are run, that would be my 13th reason). The manager knew I had worked for Starbucks in the summer, and it feels like I'm the most experienced in that store (but to put it into perspective I've only worked at Starbucks for 2 months, some of thess people have been working at the campus store for years... I'm trying to meet with the manager and express my concerns but before I do I want to make sure I am in the right here, and if you could advice me how to go over these issues without it sounding like ""I know better, I should run the store"" bc no, I don't know better, I'm just doing  part time, and I won't offer to be a shift supervisor bc I know that takes training and weekly meetings which I would probably not be able to go to with how packed my schedule is (I'm studying to be a teacher and I have to do in-person observations for my courses, add the clubs I'm in, and the other classes, I barely make time to work and study). 

There is a lot of other stuff too I could mention, like how everyone leaves the milks outside the fridge and without the cap... I'm not joking, I've had to ask for 2% milk 10+ times during each shift I've been so far. Bc they keep moving it around, because no one restocks until were fully out of the last bottle of milk... like I said, I'm honestly really stressed by this situation and I wonder what I can do or what the manager can do to fix this. Idk what the training is for the new S.S. but she doesn't even know her Fraps, she's very sweet with me, and again none of this is personal but I can't just put a blind eye to the fact that this store is running by the grace of God or smth bc if it was an actual store I bet Karens would have drowned it and put it to rest."

2592,0,"Shares of Starbucks (Nasdaq: SBUX) ticked up 2.46% in after-hours trading on Tuesday after the coffee giant gave financial and business updates during its Investor Day event.

Store Growth: Starbucks now sees comparable store sales growth to be 7% to 9% from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2025, which is up from the range of 4% to 5%. There will be outsized comparable store sales in China due to the pandemic lockdowns.

Revenue: The company expects revenue growth between 10% to 12% from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2025. This includes earnings growth between 15% to 20%, which is up from 10% to 12%.

Business Plans: Starbucks sees this growth as a result of its newly announced $450 million investment in U.S. stores between 2023 and 2024. Meanwhile, the company also rolled out a new partnership with DoorDash (NYSE: DASH) on Tuesday.

Stock Price: These improvements are needed to turn around the company. The stock price is down 24% this year.

Final Thoughts: Investors should be excited about these plans. New CEO Laxman Narasimhan starts his role on October 1.

However, even though I've found a new store to work at, I apparently am not eligible to transfer because I've worked here less than 6 months. I'm currently on a leave of absence while I try to find a new store that ends in a week, and I'll still be listed as working at my old store (which is hundreds of miles away from where I live now) when it does. 

What needs to happen now? My old DM/SM and the DM/SM where I'm trying to transfer are giving me lots of conflicting information about the process and there's no way in hell it gets done in a week.

My manager always has something to say about my attitude or the way I come into work or how I work.
I work opening shifts and before this job I've never had to wake up that early before. I was always getting up at 9 am rather than 4 am in the morning.
Recently she's said this:
1. When I come into work, even if im tired and mentally/emotionally exhausted, I should greet all of my coworkers and say good morning and get right to work.
2. I can't do dishes during peak (which I haven't done for the past 2 weeks. I'm trying not to piss anyone off and just stay out on the floor as much as possible)
3. I have to stop being disrespectful to my shift leaders. ( everyone assumes I'm being disrespectful when I forget to acknowledge them when they ask me to do something. Usually during peak. I get so stressed out I forget to tap the headset to acknowledge them. Sometimes I even forget to put my headset back on as our front/CS because I'm constantly taking orders up front and forget to put it back on.)
4. No drinks on the floor. I usually just drink water but sometimes when we get a second rush and I just made a drink for myself, I don't have time to run it back there. Or I'm so cold in the mornings now that I ask if it's okay for me to just drink a hot tea. My shifts usually tell me it's fine and I don't have any other drinks out.

Toughing it out, is exactly what I've been doing and it's not enough anymore.

I‚Äôve been reading the contract and all the booklets they give you when you are hired, and I find it to be quite confusing.

In the chart it is written that baristas that have been working for less than 3months have to give a 1 week notice and +3 months is 2 weeks notice. But, for shifts if you‚Äôve been working for less than 3 months it‚Äôs just 1 week and if it‚Äôs more it‚Äôs 4 weeks. The confusing thing is  which one applies to me. Because it‚Äôs been less than 3 months as a shift but more than 3 months in the company. 

I work in the UK, and I‚Äôm aware that almost everyone here works in the States, but it would be really helpful if someone could help me solve this or if they could tell me how they understand it.

I was having lots of anxiety as the people their seemed very standoffish and unwelcoming when I got there and the shift was very unhelpful. It was a rough first few hours getting used to a different store layout, but then a new shift gets on the floor. New shift is very welcoming and helpful, really helped me feel more comfortable on a new floor and helped me relax and find my flow. Afternoon rolls in and I'm now in the window.

this kinda goes for any partners helping out at other stores. you mold to what that store does for the time that you're there. if you don't like that, don't work at other stores. 

Thanks for reading."

Trans woman, 23, diagnosed with gender dysphoria at 4, transitioned at 16/17 &amp; medically at 18. 

I have had Ky Medicaid my whole life which covered HRT &amp; bottom surgery. Nothing more. I got Tricare in 2020 which essentially is a fight for hormones alone, &amp; no other surgeries being offered. 

I have my consultation for breast augmentation on the 30th as I was going to pay for it myself, however, Discovering my surgeon accepts Aetna, I went the Starbucks route. 

I had my interview today, 100% getting hired, will know for sure on Monday. 

My issue is, I have no idea what is going on with starbucks insurance, the new policy changes, or what exactly I need to do step-by-step wise. 

I already have letters from therapists referring me for surgery, 4-5 years hrt, 7 years living as the preferred gender, the criteria is met. 

What do I need to do to, once I‚Äôm hired &amp; working 20 hours a week minimum, to make a breast augmentation happen. Will I choose my plan that my surgeon accepts (Aetna) and be enrolled in that on December 1st (1st day of the month following 2nd month?) Will I then have the green light to schedule? 

My surgeon is an hour away at the states largest hospital so I assume he would be considered in network if that is what the policy change is about. 

Would love to just hear your tips or experience &amp; timeline &amp; really learn as much as I can before I begin nothing management &amp; trans advisors (I don‚Äôt even know what those are!) 

TLDR - How long after start date until coverage is able to be used for surgery, criteria is already met prior, tips for step-by-step to make this happen as quickly as possible.

This is also so I can stick the ticket onto the bag when the food is in the oven and place any necessary items into the bag.

I know technically I can have up to 200mg a day which would allow me to have a grande size but I‚Äôm trying to limit my caffeine intake further. I know decaf still has some caffeine but would be well within my daily limit. I know there isn‚Äôt a decaf option for cold brew but was wondering if there are any substitutions that would make it similar.

3050,0,"I do not care about Starbucks. I do not think most of the stuff we sell is any good, and absolutely none of it is worth what they charge. When someone is doing a hack to save money I am not being robbed. But let me tell you why I care about standards. 

I care about standards because this is a big chain with many locations in each geographical area. That means most customers visit more than one Starbucks in their area. They might have a regular store they visit, but maybe also one by work or one by the shopping center or whatever. 

I do not care about the customer's experience. I do not care that it is consistent. This is not why I care about standards. 

What I care about is the customer's *expectations*, and how that can impact my fellow workers at stores that are not my own. Now the customer, you must understand, is a low-intelligence, high-demand creature, one that lives largely on sugars and foams. These customers, little more than feral sugar pursuers, do not know what is in their drinks, do not know how their drinks are made, do not usually even know the actual names of their drinks. But what they do know is that if one store lets them make a fake latte by getting two shots in a grande cup, light ice, fill it with half and half, they will come to expect that. What they do know is that if one store lets them get their Americano in a trenta cup, they will expect that. 

Now, when that customer heads to another store, a store where perhaps the employees stick to standards, that customer will - more likely than not! - become a monstrous pain in the ass to the low-paid worker who is just trying to make a drink the way they were taught to make a drink. 

What this means is that a barista at location A, by training their customers that they can get whatever they want however they want, is making the life of a barista at location B much, much harder. 

Standards supposedly exist to give customers a standard experience across all stores, but for me they exist to protect my fellow workers - they are the ones who will bear the brunt of the fury of the monster I create when I break standards for a customer. My greatest fear is becoming the person the customer is talking about when they say ""the other Starbucks does it for me all the time."" I never want to be the other Starbucks.

While doing training (in my own time - because my manager hasn‚Äôt scheduled training hours for me), I discovered the POD training and it would definitely benefit me, as a new trainer, as well as everyone else."

I handed it to her and she loudly yells that I put too much ice in it (which i know i didnt bc i was closely watching as i was scooping) and was coaching me while I was making her drink which kinda annoyed me and told me to remake it, so of course i grabbed it from her and started remaking it, at this point i started shaking bc of my anxiety and with customers watching and waiting on me. This time i put like 2 of 3 ice cubes in it, shook it up then handed it to her, but then she freaks the heck out over the foam in her drinks saying its too much! and she starts being really rude, talking loudly where other customers in the grocery store could hear and I just felt my anxiety spike, i started shaking really bad though i tried to control it. i literally almost walked out &amp; cried bc there was no need to be that mad and yell at me when you see im the only one there and im new (well not really anymore). the third time, it was finally fine and she didnt say anything but i still felt hurt a bit.

I handed it to her and she loudly yells that I put too much ice in it (which i know i didnt bc i was closely watching as i was scooping) and was coaching me while I was making her drink which kinda annoyed me and told me to remake it, so of course i grabbed it from her and started remaking it, at this point i started shaking bc of my anxiety and with customers watching and waiting on me. This time i put like 2 of 3 ice cubes in it, shook it up then handed it to her, but then she freaks the heck out over the foam in her drinks saying its too much! and she starts being really rude, talking loudly where other customers in the grocery store could hear and I just felt my anxiety spike, i started shaking really bad though i tried to control it. i literally almost walked out &amp; cried bc there was no need to be that mad and yell at me when you see im the only one there and im new (well not really anymore). the third time, it was finally fine and she didnt say anything but i still felt hurt a bit.

Back then, I felt so inspired and enthusiastic during my first few weeks of working. Old co-workers were so nice and customers clearly have patience with me. With practice, I become better at everything. Not gonna lie, I learned a lot. But ever since then, things felt so different. Every day I walked in, it was literally peak period. There were aggressive customers who rang mad-modification drinks, I even felt super bad for making their over-sugared drinks for them. Although there were some regulars and partners that warmed my heart, all of them had left sadly. Literally every week I will see a new face smh. I am cool with new people joining our community, but our store is so busy. And clearly, they are not ready for such tasks. So all my shifts just have to put me on the bar. I was lucky enough that I even had done hot bar, cold bar, and mobile bar as a continuous rotation throughout the same shift.

Once in a long while, my coworkers will text me to do a check-in and see how life is going, but now, they only texted me when they want their shift covered or help because people called out.

strict schedule (manageable, but i like flexibility)

pros:

i know the manager is good

no drive through 

drive through store:

closer to my house

schedule flexibility

cons:

drive through store

currently they have no SM‚Ä¶. red flag to me

what do you think i should do? or what would you personally do? 

i know it is subjective but im having trouble discerning which one seems like the smarter decision. thanks in advance!"

3348,0,"Hello baristas, I have a question to ask of those of you who have been at stores for a while and seen new partners come and go. I am a fairly new hire (beginning of last month) and was hired at the same time as another girl. There were two other new hires before us, and there have been two since.

My manager has made comments a few times that I am falling behind the other girl, even having her ""supervise"" me making drinks. We work very similar hours, but usually different shifts, so technically, we should both be getting bar practice. But it does not seem to be the manager's priority to give me any, putting me on bar for 10-20 minutes in a 4 hours shift before sending me to clean bathrooms, hand out on drive or do customer support. My supervisors and manager are VERY strict about the plays and roles, so it's not like I can ask them to put me on bar longer.  

When we were finishing training, our trainer told us that we wouldn't get much time on bar for the first few weeks as the previous two newbies needed that time. But now that the two new hires are out of the training modules and in the bar, the supervisor has been putting them on bar over me again, so I am still not getting practice.

It is beginning to make me wonder if they have already decided that they are going to fire me once the new people are trained. The jobs that they put me on need very little training, and it feels like they are just keeping me around as a helper until they can replace me with someone else. On top of that, I am not being given enough hours (no weekends despite being available) to reach benefits, which makes me even more suspicious that they aren't bothering to put that much effort into me because I won't be around long.

Do you think I am reading too much into these behaviors, or have you seen something similar happen before with a new hire? I just keep waiting for the play caller to put me on bar, but it never comes. I'm beginning to feel a bit discouraged with the whole situation.

Thanks for any feedback you can give me!",Am I being replaced?,1662480105,"Am I being replaced?

I've had 4 managers in the months I've worked for a licensed store. The third one wasn't really a manager but was the one with seniority. She only opened and never closes, i switch from open to mid to closer depending on weeks. Whenever anything went wrong she would blame me, even if it wasn't my fault. She was ""nice"" before being put in the position. About halfway into her being ""manager"" she told me that I have been clocking off, without doing anything before leaving, like leaving mid rush or not making sure I take the trash out. Even though I'm not able to take trash.

I had told her, I understood her concerns but I also explained that I need to clock off when I'm off because we aren't allowed overtime and get a meeting with the boss if we do so often and ill try to do better, plus I'm not allowed to do trash because of reasons. I also said this has happened to me before with other ppl and asked if this is a issue that needs to be brought up to managers now?? She had told me that I need to comunicate with the other baristas and not to bring anything up with managers or management and if I do, she'll tell our bosses and that I don't do anything during my shifts. 

Even now when she's not manager she tell me, it's not hard to do simple things or that I half-a$$ everything or don't do anything correctly. She is leaving in month, should I say something to her about this treatment or should I just wait it out???

So I'm like 1.5 months on board, past training, and have been taught closing. I'm kind of frustrated because I am available all day 5 days a week, 6 coming soon. This said, store manager is still bringing in new hires and I just heard today they are looking for an opener. I only get scheduled 28 hours a week. I have mentioned in the nicest ways that I would live longer shifts. 

When I covered for someone:
""Hey I *really* appreciated the longer shift."" in a text. 

When a customer asked if they were hiring and I heard about the opener shift, once they left I said:
""Feel free to train me and I'd love to do it.""

At the end of closing today I told my SM a third time:
""I would really love to work longer hours,"" which got a silent smile and nod.

When I applied and interviewed for this job I said I was looking for as much of a full time schedule as possible. I take every opportunity to cover for people. I have had no complaints and when I asked how I was doing after initial training I was told I am above average for a new person. Since then, I can work bars, CS, Customer Support, planted or not. I might ask one question a day about a drink I haven't heard of or a specialty order.

...Yet we are bringing on 2 kids not old enough to work a full week by law, just finished training one before them, and apparently we need an opener.

I want large shifts, 8 hour shifts / 40 a week or as close as possible. What should I do? At this point I feel like I'm a bother by bringing it up.

The only thing I considered was that the SM told me at hiring that they try to keep people in training under 6 hours, but I'm not getting trained anymore. There are a few modules to do that are very obscure and SM hasn't made time for (due today actually). But I was also told that, as a person who wants Starbucks health insurance, that the store prioritizes hours for those people. Right now I'm going to *narrowly* make the 3 month consecutive hours to obtain insurance.

Advice? I've been so direct to SM. When you make 15.50 an hour I don't get why we need sooooo many people. I'm here, I'm available, I've made it known. Everyone likes me. Do I share my interest with the district manager at this point? The only thing close to an acknowledgement my SM was after I told them I'd be available for an extra day come October, to which they replied, ""Awesome! We need people on those days."" I don't get it.

Well, it used to be, but ever since they started serving them in those straw-less cups, drinking one has been an existential nightmare.

I was reminded of this today when I got that new Apple Crisp Iced Macchiato. Delicious, except the lack of a straw made it subpar. One of the things I love about some Starbucks drinks is how layered they are, something relatively unique among most coffee places. Having a straw lets you experience each layer as you desire. This is doubly true for anything with caramel or other heavy sauce in it, since it sinks to the bottom. You can use the straw to get a little bit of sweet syrupy goodness into your sip whenever you feel like it.

Except with these (relatively) new cups, that's a thing of the past. You don't get to experience the layers, you just chug the espresso part until you get to the milk, unless of course you shake the whole thing until it becomes a completely different drink. And forget about tasting any of that syrup, it's gonna stick to the bottom of the cup the whole way through.

I literally never get these drinks on the go anymore, I can only have them when I've gotten home, and can use a spoon or something to experience each layer, and I don't to explain to anyone why that's a miserable experience.

Does anybody have the policy for that? And am I wrong and responsible for finding my own coverage?"

&amp;#x200B;

Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I hope this is allowed. I see a lot of baristas on TikTok talk about their negative experiences being employed with Starbucks and I wanted to share mine. This might be sorta long so thanks in advance if you choose to read.

I came to Starbucks as a barista with several years of supervisory experience at another high-volume food chain. I trained at a different store than the one I was hired at and was noticed as a fast learner by management and other partners alike, with some even making ""undercover boss"" jokes because I didn't seem like a trainee. After about three months and with some encouragement from several shift supervisors at my store and the one I trained at, I applied to be a shift supervisor at my training store. I interviewed and got picked the same day, which meant more hours and a major pay raise for me, which I was in desperate need of because I had recently left a toxic relationship and I was financially devastated. I was SO excited about this opportunity, it was everything I ever wanted!

The beginnings at my new store were rough. My first day went as planned with mostly computer-based training the whole day. The next day, another shift supervisor tested positive for COVID-19 and went into isolation, along with several other partners and I believe another shift supervisor too. I was told I would be a regular barista for the week and my training would resume the following week, which was no big deal. 

The following week, I thought my training would continue as planned. I thought I would finish the computer training, shadow a supervisor for the week, and then be on my own. On the first day of continuing my training, I came in for a mid-shift and was told I was actually running the floor. And so training was over. I had mentioned this to the ASM and SM later on as I was concerned I wouldn't know everything and mess something up but they insisted I got my full training and I was fine.

I thought I did mostly well. A lot of other partners were really annoyed with my presence as they wanted my role (and deserved it more since they were far more seasoned). It was so intimidating because I felt like all eyes were on me and any question I asked about this store's particular setup (I couldn't remember from when I first trained there) and SS-related questions felt like I was being discredited and it was proof I wasn't qualified for my role. After a while, however, I think I grew on most of them and I even made some friends. 

I was dedicated to my job. I loved it. I felt I went the extra mile quite often there. I covered others when I could, went in early/stayed late almost every time I could, and never had a problem switching with other shifts. I never gave any of my partners trouble about calling out/leaving early/whatever and always made it work even though I was only ever given JUST enough partners to make the store run with no ""wiggle room"" (if I lost one partner for the night it guaranteed complete chaos).  I never turned away a barista that needed a ride home.  Being mainly a closing shift, I was the only authority in the building from 2 pm to close, and I had to deal with a lot of dangerous situations (unpredictable homeless people, drugs being done in the bathroom, etc.) But I always faced it. 

Things got sort of rocky about 2 months into this role.  One of the shifts that also worked close showed me that when she comes in, she takes one till from each register and two from one of the front registers as you usually don't need it for the rest of the night, so I started doing that. On one shift where the ASM worked with me for a few hours, he found out and scolded me. He had put that till back in and I had completely forgotten as I was so used to taking it out, so it stayed in the register overnight. Not too long later, I had closed and left the cash pouch in the back, on the desk. That was my verbal warning. I was told I would receive a written warning next time, and if I made another mistake after that I would be terminated. 

I was starting to stress. Things in my personal life were also not great and my mental health was taking a nosedive. There were multiple occasions where I tried to get my shift covered because I just felt like I couldn't do it but management told me there were no shifts who could cover it as everyone was already at 40 hours. Every time I worked I was terrified my next mistake was around the corner. I had asked management multiple times if I could switch to mids or mornings. I explained that I felt that nights were for more seasoned shifts as they work it alone with no other shift or manager to peer review. My store's opens usually had the SM, ASM, and two shifts. Our mid usually had one shift that overlapped with open and close but they had no open/close duties obviously. It just didn't feel fair that on top of not being properly trained, I had all this responsibility, and nobody was ever there to check that I wasn't missing anything. They told me there was just no way for me to not work closes. I tried to do my best with what I had and take a more positive outlook on things. I got myself a to-do list of the most important things to check, I was seeing a therapist through Starbucks, and I felt like I was doing better.

It was clean play night. I had agreed to work every clean play in exchange for working two mids a week and being off on Thursdays and Fridays (which I never received). In the weeks prior I had been asking the ASM if the morning shifts had any feedback for me on my clean plays as nobody ever left comments in the book. I never got trained on what to clean save for one night I did it alongside the SM, but we had a callout so he said we were going to half-ass it just this once. There weren't guides on Store Resources for every single thing listed on the clean play checklist. I was eager to know how to do EVERYTHING in the store so I was constantly looking to improve. one of these days when I asked, the ASM wanted to know what I didn't know so I asked him to show me how I'm supposed to clean the cold brew system and he basically just showed me to wipe down the top parts. This day, though, he told me he had feedback from the morning shifts and he listed a bunch of things not getting done, including the cold brew. He then gave me just a verbal walkthrough of the super complicated ACTUAL way you're supposed to clean it which was not what I was told by him before. He gave me a resource printout and was sure to leave at his scheduled time as always. 

The night was super stressful, I tried to take apart and clean it myself but even though I did it as instructed it wasn't working. He tried to walk me through it over text but ultimately told me I had to leave it because it was clogged from not being cleaned correctly for weeks on end, which he definitely blamed me for. By the time he told me to give up and leave it for the morning, it was 11 and I still had to count drawers. By the time I was done, my partners had long been finished with their tasks and were waiting on me. As I was going to put the drawers in the safe, the bottom one slipped and they all spilled on the floor. In tears, I had to pick up the coins and recount everything. I told my partners to just go home. I know I wasn't supposed to be there alone but they had been waiting so long already. I finished around 12:30 I think and finally went home.

The next day, I was feeling much better. I had just finished the process of applying for the ASU program, and I was feeling very thrilled about the opportunity to finish the biology degree that I've been trying to get for 4 years. Immediately after I called and scheduled a meeting with an SM next to my boyfriend's house because I was moving and this store was looking for a morning shift. I was so thrilled.

But when I came in, I got fired. I had left the deposit bag on top of the pastry case ""overnight"" (opening shift comes in at 3:30 so for three hours) and therefore I needed to be automatically terminated, but I was welcome to apply anywhere as a barista after thirty days.

That was 5 months ago. I have applied to so many Starbucks here so many times, I have called and talked to the SM's about my specific situation, asking to just be a barista, but they never moved forward with me. I have probably applied to at least 300 jobs since then and haven't landed a single one. I'm constantly on job boards looking for the next ad. I can't even doordash because my car is broken down and I can't afford to fix it so now I'm limited to remote jobs or jobs within walking distance. Debt collectors are constantly calling me. I've had not a single dime for five months. I tried to apply for unemployment twice but Starbucks fought it and won. I'm still grieving everything I lost; my job, my chance to go back to school, my path to financial stability. and I hate myself so so much for that negligent stupid mistake and now I'll never get redemption, and I still feel like I was let down by management who promised to support me in my journey but rarely lifted a finger for me when I needed it. I know I should be over it by now, but, you know... what I could have been. Something so much different.",Terminated From Starbucks- My Story,1662340187,"Terminated From Starbucks- My Story TLDR: I was fired after management neglected my proper training and I made too many mistakes after reaching out for help several times and being let down.

I was dedicated to my job. I loved it. I felt I went the extra mile quite often there. I covered others when I could, went in early/stayed late almost every time I could, and never had a problem switching with other shifts. I never gave any of my partners trouble about calling out/leaving early/whatever and always made it work even though I was only ever given JUST enough partners to make the store run with no ""wiggle room"" (if I lost one partner for the night it guaranteed complete chaos).  I never turned away a barista that needed a ride home.  Being mainly a closing shift, I was the only authority in the building from 2 pm to close, and I had to deal with a lot of dangerous situations (unpredictable homeless people, drugs being done in the bathroom, etc.) But I always faced it. 

Things got sort of rocky about 2 months into this role.  One of the shifts that also worked close showed me that when she comes in, she takes one till from each register and two from one of the front registers as you usually don't need it for the rest of the night, so I started doing that. On one shift where the ASM worked with me for a few hours, he found out and scolded me. He had put that till back in and I had completely forgotten as I was so used to taking it out, so it stayed in the register overnight. Not too long later, I had closed and left the cash pouch in the back, on the desk. That was my verbal warning. I was told I would receive a written warning next time, and if I made another mistake after that I would be terminated. 

I was starting to stress. Things in my personal life were also not great and my mental health was taking a nosedive. There were multiple occasions where I tried to get my shift covered because I just felt like I couldn't do it but management told me there were no shifts who could cover it as everyone was already at 40 hours. Every time I worked I was terrified my next mistake was around the corner. I had asked management multiple times if I could switch to mids or mornings. I explained that I felt that nights were for more seasoned shifts as they work it alone with no other shift or manager to peer review. My store's opens usually had the SM, ASM, and two shifts. Our mid usually had one shift that overlapped with open and close but they had no open/close duties obviously. It just didn't feel fair that on top of not being properly trained, I had all this responsibility, and nobody was ever there to check that I wasn't missing anything. They told me there was just no way for me to not work closes. I tried to do my best with what I had and take a more positive outlook on things. I got myself a to-do list of the most important things to check, I was seeing a therapist through Starbucks, and I felt like I was doing better.

It was clean play night. I had agreed to work every clean play in exchange for working two mids a week and being off on Thursdays and Fridays (which I never received). In the weeks prior I had been asking the ASM if the morning shifts had any feedback for me on my clean plays as nobody ever left comments in the book. I never got trained on what to clean save for one night I did it alongside the SM, but we had a callout so he said we were going to half-ass it just this once. There weren't guides on Store Resources for every single thing listed on the clean play checklist. I was eager to know how to do EVERYTHING in the store so I was constantly looking to improve. one of these days when I asked, the ASM wanted to know what I didn't know so I asked him to show me how I'm supposed to clean the cold brew system and he basically just showed me to wipe down the top parts. This day, though, he told me he had feedback from the morning shifts and he listed a bunch of things not getting done, including the cold brew. He then gave me just a verbal walkthrough of the super complicated ACTUAL way you're supposed to clean it which was not what I was told by him before. He gave me a resource printout and was sure to leave at his scheduled time as always. 

The night was super stressful, I tried to take apart and clean it myself but even though I did it as instructed it wasn't working. He tried to walk me through it over text but ultimately told me I had to leave it because it was clogged from not being cleaned correctly for weeks on end, which he definitely blamed me for. By the time he told me to give up and leave it for the morning, it was 11 and I still had to count drawers. By the time I was done, my partners had long been finished with their tasks and were waiting on me. As I was going to put the drawers in the safe, the bottom one slipped and they all spilled on the floor. In tears, I had to pick up the coins and recount everything. I told my partners to just go home. I know I wasn't supposed to be there alone but they had been waiting so long already. I finished around 12:30 I think and finally went home.

The next day, I was feeling much better. I had just finished the process of applying for the ASU program, and I was feeling very thrilled about the opportunity to finish the biology degree that I've been trying to get for 4 years. Immediately after I called and scheduled a meeting with an SM next to my boyfriend's house because I was moving and this store was looking for a morning shift. I was so thrilled.

But when I came in, I got fired. I had left the deposit bag on top of the pastry case ""overnight"" (opening shift comes in at 3:30 so for three hours) and therefore I needed to be automatically terminated, but I was welcome to apply anywhere as a barista after thirty days.

That was 5 months ago. I have applied to so many Starbucks here so many times, I have called and talked to the SM's about my specific situation, asking to just be a barista, but they never moved forward with me. I have probably applied to at least 300 jobs since then and haven't landed a single one. I'm constantly on job boards looking for the next ad. I can't even doordash because my car is broken down and I can't afford to fix it so now I'm limited to remote jobs or jobs within walking distance. Debt collectors are constantly calling me. I've had not a single dime for five months. I tried to apply for unemployment twice but Starbucks fought it and won. I'm still grieving everything I lost; my job, my chance to go back to school, my path to financial stability. and I hate myself so so much for that negligent stupid mistake and now I'll never get redemption, and I still feel like I was let down by management who promised to support me in my journey but rarely lifted a finger for me when I needed it. I know I should be over it by now, but, you know... what I could have been. Something so much different."

As a customer Im generally satisfied with the way you handle orders, most of the time its seamless and once I submit my mobile order I pick it up trough drive tru in 10 min or less, never had an issue and I‚Äôve been ordering this way for more than a year.

Fast forward to the past two months and for one reason or another I‚Äôve opted to pick up the mobile order at the store instead of using drive tru, this has ‚Äúopened my eyes‚Äù to the level of hauling ass you guys are doing just to keep up with everything at once, which got me thinking that this will eventually burn out employees since its non stop for a good chunk of their day.

Do you feel that this is the top reason some stores have started to unionize?

Do you feel that the in store customer experience has gone down hill?

Is the mobile order function the main factor contributing to burn out?

3597,0,"Hello I am trying to get a job at Starbucks to pay for the last 9 classes I got for my degree at ASU. I had questions about these benefits.

1st is do they limit the number of classes? I cant stand customer service jobs (I have autism and extremely bad anxiety and agoraphobia) and I don't want to work at Starbucks too long. I'd like to get in and get out which means take 4 classes in the first 8 weeks of spring semester and take the last 4 in the last 8 weeks. In my major the classes are 8 weeks each so this would be possible. I'd then like to take my final class (internship) either summer or fall and I'd pay out of pocket for it.

2nd is does the rules of having to do 20 hours for 3 months to qualify still apply or has it been changed?

I asked her if she came to this store and when, just to get more background so I could check the book, since my store keeps records of those who call for a remake and she said she had. I couldn‚Äôt find any record of any remake that entire week and she didn‚Äôt know who she had spoken to and didn‚Äôt have a receipt in the app or physical, no cups, nothing. Our store has a policy where we won‚Äôt replace drinks that were made more than three days ago unless they call to let us know they won‚Äôt be able to come in until then. Come to find out she got it last Friday (the day she said she got it changed twice, but this was the final answer) so I checked that week and sure enough it still wasn‚Äôt anywhere there. To appease her, (because she said how dare I do this to her in front of her kids, who weren‚Äôt paying attention in the back seat) I remade a different frap and split it into three cups, while she called me an ‚Äúidiot with absolutely no sense‚Äú and other names and demanded my name, which I gave to her. 
This all coming the day after a lady threatened (and then feinted throwing something at me while laughing) to throw a hot drink in my face (and laughed that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to call the police because she would be long gone, she works in an ER as a nurse btw) because I was trying to resolve her issue because she was mad a barista had told her please not to honk to get our attention (still in a polite voice) and got out of her car to demand an apology and she was going to call corporate, and she wanted her name, and I wouldn‚Äôt give it to her and gave her my name instead because I was worried for that partner‚Äôs safety.

3603,0,"i've been growing as a green bean and im proud of my growth. ive been put on bar most of my shifts but today i was put on brewing station/reg. the last time i was on this position was quite a while ago so i didn't really have a clue what to do. my ssv told me to prep the blonde pour over then proceeded to hand me an entire blonde veranda bag since we ran out of the cube. i assumed that they wanted me to grind the entire bag so i did, but when they found out, they got frustrated and grilled me for it. then they took me off reg to solely focus on brewing station (and i didnt know what to do since i havent done it in a long time. all my usual shifts start AFTER the brewing station tasks are done too). i felt really stupid and like a kid.

i guess my question for this is: what am i supposed to do on brewing station? i know im supposed to watch the coffee but what else?

i am also a closer with this same ssv. dont get me wrong, they are a good person and they have well intentions, but they really have a way of treating me like im still a very new person. i am still learning but they treat me as a kid. it wasnt until my gm intervened where they finally left me alone on bar and left me alone to watch the floor. i think they low key hate me for that intervention which sucks. there will be times where i am working with another partner who has been here longer. id be doing the floors while ssv is in the back doing ssv things, so the partner is solo-ing when its dead and they'd be going back and forth for restocks, make more lemonade, get more inclusions etc and the ssv is fine with it. but when im solo-ing while its dead, the ssv grills me for ""leaving the floor empty"" (despite me taking around 10 seconds to go to the back then to the front). it's worse because the ssv will always tell me to start prepping inclucions, mocha, whipped creams and more while im solo-ing but none of the clean containers are on the floor which means i have to go to the back to get them, but i cant because im solo-ing. so me solo-ing is not productive with this rule.

3660,0,"I've been working for nearly two months as a barista. I get a lot of positive feedback from other shift managers, I get kind corrections from them, I feel safe asking questions to them or just being open with them about my thought process and clarifying the root of where I messed up if I make a mistake. At this point, they all seem to trust that I know what I'm doing in a lot of areas, that I'll ask questions when I'm unsure, and they ask me if I know how to do certain things just in case they need to clarify anything before assigning me a task or so they can ask someone else if we're busy and someone else is more prepared/knowledgeable etc. I'm constantly doing work, never just standing idly and if I am it's for 7 seconds thinking about what I should be doing   


But this one shift manager................. They tell me to do things I'm expected to do regularly, even if I've already done them. And in a way that I feel like I'm being talked AT, not to. They come look over my shoulder and criticize what I'm doing, even if it has nothing to do with any specific processes I was trained on or even if I'm literally actively doing something a certain way that they or other managers have told me to do in the past. An example of the former is that I got critiqued for having sugar packet trash right next to the cup... as I was putting in the last 2 packs of sugar.... and was already planning to throw away all the trash immediately after finishing putting in the sugar. An example of the latter was that I was pulling a bunch of warming tickets (today was busy all day so there were constantly many tickets) after running several items to hand off, and I was trying to see what all bakery I'd need to grab and if there were any doubles of anything so I could warm them at the same time. In the middle of my thinking, I got critiqued for pulling the tickets and was told I should already have things cooking in my machines. This is true. But I swear they've also been a person before to tell me I NEED to pull tickets otherwise I'm gonna fall behind by not cooking things 2 at a time when I can. This is an example of how I feel like I'm always doing SOMETHING wrong, even if I KNOW I'm doing what I've been told to do in these super specific situations. 

&amp;#x200B;

So anyway. I'm one of the only partners, even the newer ones, that I've noticed they are so stern towards with the way they interact.   


I feel suffocated and uncomfortable when I work with them. I feel like I am constantly doing something wrong or not enough, it makes it hard to keep a good attitude. Them being so critical makes me feel like my efforts (I am a very hard worker!) are not recognized. I am starting to dread working with them. Because really the vibes are like a negative cloud hanging over my head even if everything else about the shift is going well (happy interactions with customers, getting tips all throughout the shift, good vibes with my other partners, and just being aware of my own work that doesn't get recognition)",One of my shift managers continuously makes me feel like I'm always doing something wrong or not good enough,1662236704,"One of my shift managers continuously makes me feel like I'm always doing something wrong or not good enough I've been working for nearly two months as a barista. I get a lot of positive feedback from other shift managers, I get kind corrections from them, I feel safe asking questions to them or just being open with them about my thought process and clarifying the root of where I messed up if I make a mistake. At this point, they all seem to trust that I know what I'm doing in a lot of areas, that I'll ask questions when I'm unsure, and they ask me if I know how to do certain things just in case they need to clarify anything before assigning me a task or so they can ask someone else if we're busy and someone else is more prepared/knowledgeable etc. I'm constantly doing work, never just standing idly and if I am it's for 7 seconds thinking about what I should be doing   


But this one shift manager................. They tell me to do things I'm expected to do regularly, even if I've already done them. And in a way that I feel like I'm being talked AT, not to. They come look over my shoulder and criticize what I'm doing, even if it has nothing to do with any specific processes I was trained on or even if I'm literally actively doing something a certain way that they or other managers have told me to do in the past. An example of the former is that I got critiqued for having sugar packet trash right next to the cup... as I was putting in the last 2 packs of sugar.... and was already planning to throw away all the trash immediately after finishing putting in the sugar. An example of the latter was that I was pulling a bunch of warming tickets (today was busy all day so there were constantly many tickets) after running several items to hand off, and I was trying to see what all bakery I'd need to grab and if there were any doubles of anything so I could warm them at the same time. In the middle of my thinking, I got critiqued for pulling the tickets and was told I should already have things cooking in my machines. This is true. But I swear they've also been a person before to tell me I NEED to pull tickets otherwise I'm gonna fall behind by not cooking things 2 at a time when I can. This is an example of how I feel like I'm always doing SOMETHING wrong, even if I KNOW I'm doing what I've been told to do in these super specific situations.

The day after I finished my training, another partner (a ss) called and asked me to cover for them from 7:15 to 10:30).. I agreed because I figured a shift super would know if it's okay for me to be covering this early off my training. I come in and my shift is just a wreck. I was on window for about 2 hours but once they switched me to bar (my first time ever) it was so bad. The printer would not stop and there was only one person helping me. I had 30 cups with stickers lined up and ready to go and customers were getting upset. And then....someone orders 2 venti lattes with 6 packets of agave each. So here I am squeezing 13 packets of agave into these damn cups and it hits me. I cannot do this job. 

So I texted my manager the next day saying this Jon is not for me and I will not be coming back. I said it a lot nicer than that though. Should I feel bad for not giving my 2 weeks? I figured it was completely unnecessary seeing as I hadn't even finished my week of ""practice shifts"" and was absolutely not an asset to the team in any way.

3706,0,"I‚Äôm a shift and I have a barista partner that I work with FREQUENTLY (maybe 3/4 of my shifts are with them). We have the closing shift, so it‚Äôs typically just me and them. They‚Äôve been one of the main closing baristas basically since they transferred to our store. And they‚Äôve been at our store for probably 5 months now. They were a partner at another store for a few months before that. 

So, at this point, they should really have a grasp on how to do just about everything. We even have a written out closing list. But for some reason‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs like I have to tell them HOW to close during EVERY close. If they aren‚Äôt sure what to do, they‚Äôll just‚Ä¶ kind of pretend??? To wipe the counters???? It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm SEEING wiping happening, but I guess it‚Äôs just too gentle?? Almost like they‚Äôre wiping the counters to look busy instead of doing it to clean them.

The part that I need advice about isn‚Äôt even really that. It‚Äôs the fact that this barista‚Ä¶ works so slowly. All. The. Time. We have several green beans now and they‚Äôre all essentially lapping this barista. We‚Äôll have customers waiting for a single drink for 5 minutes. And this partner won‚Äôt even use that time to connect with the customers. Sometimes I‚Äôll work with a barista that doesn‚Äôt really connect, but it‚Äôs because they make the drinks so fast that the customer doesn‚Äôt even notice. But with this barista‚Ä¶ the customers just sit there for FAR too long‚Ä¶ waiting for their drink. It‚Äôs not even just making drinks that takes too long. It‚Äôs every task.

So, I guess my question is: how do I tell this partner to PICK UP THE DAMN PACE? It does get frustrating for myself and other partners having to feel like we all have to do our own jobs, as well as half of this partner‚Äôs job.

Caramel sauce (in bottom)
Extra whip 
4 packets salt on top

4. Same as number 3 (whip and caramel in a cup with salt.)

This lady complains that her order cost $11 and not $10 because apparently another store rang it up differently. Then she stands behind the bar making sure we make them correctly and complains about being late to work (seriously if you are late somewhere, DONT STOP FOR COFFEE). Then when she left, our delivery truck was there and she was blocked in so she yelled at nobody in the parking lot because the drivers were in our back of house, and when our awesome driver went to move the truck for her, SHE CALLED THE COPS ON HIM! Luckily the cops must‚Äôve known it was bs so they didn‚Äôt show."

3740,0,"I walked in today, threw my keys in the safe and quit.

I started at a drive thru Starbucks that was busiest in the district and loved it. I was living in my car attempting to survive and I appreciate the company for that.

Moved to a city and went to a Starbucks that did 15k+ a day and can only be described as a place where baristas go to lose hope for 6 months before transferring to a cafe. All 7 of the transfers that came while I was there all quit by their third shift.

My distain for the company slowly increasing over the last two years, watching my baristas getting screamed at and my bosses saying there‚Äôs nothing we can do. Watching all the illegal anti union activity that Starbucks was doing.  My boss promising more hours and eventually going from 30-40 a week to 9 with him saying there‚Äôs nothing he can do but he‚Äôs sure it will pick up next quarter( after I go through the majority of my savings of him promising more hours this quarter and scrambling to make rent for three months)

I finally hit a point a week ago where I was reprimanded for being too talkative on register by my boss(outside hire).

I found a much better paying job with tips an a much more professional setting and I feel the weight of the world being lifted off my shoulders.

3745,0,"I quit Starbucks yesterday and my mental health immediately improved. This is the tea I was scared to spill and share because I did not want to jeopardize my job. Now, I don‚Äôt care. Y‚Äôall need to know the truth.

While there was coworkers who I truly enjoyed working with, there were some I truly did not. I will just leave that at that. That‚Äôs with any place, right? But when the problem people aren‚Äôt corrected, that‚Äôs an issue. Anyways‚Ä¶

I loved learning about coffee and honing the craft, but quickly it became apparent that Starbucks no longer cares about that. They just want to continue making billions off of their dedicated followers and their sugar infused coffee addiction.

While working there, I dealt with some of the worst working conditions I have ever been faced with.

Firstly, the fruit fly problem. If you want my advice as a former employee, ask for no fruit pieces in your refreshers. Don‚Äôt get anything with vanilla bean powder, chocolate malt powder, java/frappuccino chips, and matcha. These are all stored in semi-open containers that do not close fully. Therefore, fruit flies chill in and on the containers. I had to work the day before we got the pest control treatment for our store and a fruit fly flew up my nose. They were landing all over me. Landing in drinks, landing on food. Some baristas didn‚Äôt even throw the drink away they would still hand it out. A fruit fly was found in the cold brew keg before we closed it up and my shift scooped it out and put the lid on to use it still. So, additionally I wouldn‚Äôt drink the cold brew. I wanted to quit there and then.

Secondly, the store I worked at needed a remodel so so badly. It had ceiling tiles missing, our AC would break all the time, and the drain would constantly back up. When I, the ONLY one who spoke up at the store meetings with our district manager, asked about a remodel she said ‚ÄúOther stores would be grateful for what you have.‚Äù We were told we were on the list but low on the list for a remodel. Two store meetings later the district manager announces two new stores. So they can build new stores that no one asked for but can‚Äôt improve the already existing stores? Awesome! 

Our ovens literally set the pastries on fire. Cookies would light on fire. Sandwiches won‚Äôt cook all the way through. They‚Äôre still waiting on new ovens. We finally got new espresso machines the beginning of this year. How does a billion dollar company not have the funds to outfit every store with quality equipment?

Thirdly, (and this has nothing to do with the company‚Ä¶ although, they encourage this ‚Äúcustomization‚Äù culture) the customers are 80% entitled assholes.  
Even when I worked at Olive Garden, McDonald‚Äôs, Cheddars, etc. I never encountered some of these kinds of people. I got cursed out for being out of Sugar Free Vanilla. I got yelled at through the speaker box because I was out of caramel drizzle. I got complained about because this man was yelling at me about how he wanted his latte made &amp; I corrected him for being an asshole (respectfully, with much effort). A man once asked me for exactly 16 ice cubes. I was making someone else‚Äôs drink with the standard scoop of ice and he threw a fit thinking it was his drink. I looked at him dead in the eye and said ‚ÄúThis is not your drink.‚Äù His face turned red from embarrassment and he sat his ass down. People complained about their mobile orders never being ready when the truth is, everyone and their momma is sending their order in between 6 am and 10 am so you are gonna have a wait regardless, Karen. Don‚Äôt yell at me cause your 4 venti (large) overly sugared and complicated lattes aren‚Äôt ready. In truth we needed a third espresso machine, but we‚Äôre lucky to have what we did, remember? üì∑

Fourth, the management. During the time I was there (11 months) there was two Store Managers. The manager that hired me left two months later. We were without a store manager until about february/march. The man that was a hired (a truly kind man) was an outside hire who was entirely new to Starbucks. He lasted 3 or 4 months I think, no offense to him. He did his best trying to make our store better and they ran him off.  He left at the beginning of July. We were without a set store manager for the month of August and instead of us getting a new one they pinned our store onto another store manager! She doesn‚Äôt answer texts, you can only call her. When you did call her you got voicemailed. And if you or what you had to say wasn‚Äôt considered important? Good luck getting a response! 

I asked to have a meeting with District Manager to discuss all of these issues above, and yet was met with contempt because I was ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù to reach out to the temporary Store Manager who had her own store to run and doesn‚Äôt answer calls. I never fully got to express any of this to anyone but other Baristas at work who were also fed up.

I am grateful for the wonderful people I met, but I implore you, if you‚Äôve read this far, to go to a local coffee shop. The whole company needs to unionize. There is no reason our store should be as dilapidated as it is when we‚Äôre one of the top earning stores. SBUX CEO can get a billion dollar bonus, and we can‚Äôt get new machines.  


There is way way more I could share, but I close with this:

Grateful to have learned what I did, met who I did. It was a complete learning experience. I‚Äôm just all in all disappointed. I wanted to work there since I was 16 years old. Sad that my expectations weren‚Äôt met by this Forbes listed company to work for.

When I politely asked for the passcode, she/he replied there is no such thing as a restroom in this store. 

So I pointed to the place where all the people were using it, and then he/she replied "" oh there was one? I did NOT know that"" with a very sarcastic tone. 

I asked him/her again politely (ex. could you ask your co-worker) since that denial attitude was appearing to be intentional, and he/she was clearly rejecting to respond to my question.

Then he said, ""then I don't know lol lol ?""

The employee's attitude was distinctly rude and intentionally denied to tell to the specific person. I found this extremely disrespectful and I truly felt that was racial discrimination. 

I understand that everyone has a tough day, but this situation like asking for a passcode would not possibly make any employee upset. 

After that, I shared this conversation with the employee who‚Äôs in charge of the store at the moment,

3839,0,"**tl;dr at end**

I'm here to rant because this particularly involves my current (and new - since mid early August) job at Starbucks. So, to first provide my context, I stopped working at a restaurant job (that I was fairly new in late April-early June this year) to pursue my professional certificate in cybersecurity. I had stopped working for about 2 months because I passed this certification after 2 months of hardcore studying (woo!). I decided to quit the restaurant job that I was working at because I never really liked the workplace anyways and it wasn't my cup of tea when it comes to working in the service industry. Management also sucked too.

Fast forward, I'm now hired at Starbucks and currently working as a new employee when school starts. Since I had switched my majors, it's taking a bit longer for me to finish my degree so I decided that it was in my best interest to do an extra load of classes. These **online** classes were already accelerated enough but instead of the standard full load of 5 classes, I did 6. (these classes are a quarter long, btw. 8 weeks each and there's the first 8 weeks of the semester \[first session\] then the 2nd 8 weeks of the semester \[2nd session\] so the classes are divided by 2). I had already planned this out before I got my job at Starbucks and now that school has started, I'm starting to realize the consequences of having a physically tiring job with an overload of school work. Though I only have 3 classes, all of them are expecting of all students to do continuous studying and engagement, combined with labs, projects, and tests.

Throughout this whole ordeal I also found out that I needed to pay for my own tuition for this upcoming winter semester and I'm about $5000 short so I'm trying to earn as much as I can so my parents don't have to pay as much and we can split the money. So me working is definitely a necessity.

I guess the best way to sum up my problem is that my (somewhat) physically and mentally (sometimes) taxing job at starbucks is not mixing well with the extra load of class that I'm taking. It's already hard enough to find time to go to the gym and enjoy my own time but it seems like I'm either working, studying, eating (while working and studying), or sleeping. While I know that the most common solution right now would be to lower my hours, I don't think that lowering hours would help my case since I still need to earn enough to where I can afford to pay for most of my tuition next semester.

I've been thinking about a job that's remote and something along the lines of customer service. Which not only makes it easier for me to manage my time with classes but also just to get out of the food/beverage industry. I've been working in the this industry since 2019 and needless to say, I'm quite exhausted from all the physical hard work and mental stress when it comes to dealing with hangry customers.

**tl;dr** \- i'm stuck at a wall. I hate to leave my new coworkers because everyone is so nice and I hate the idea of job hopping but I'm also realizing that the physical and mental demand of starbucks is not mixing well with the stress of my classes but i'm forced to work due to tuition so i really dont know what to do",(RANT) School is clashing with job,1662093775,"(RANT) School is clashing with job **tl;dr at end**

ALSO! there‚Äôs always something broken or that we‚Äôre out of and the time it takes to get it fixed only for it to break again or run out again within hours is insane!!! i‚Äôm absolutely sure this is not a problem specific to my store but moving on

as we all know, pumpkin spice season started 2 days ago. so naturally, we‚Äôve been pretty damn busy. we still have the old mastrenas at my store, so we pull blonde from the drive bar hopper and decaf from the cafe bar one. the entire drive thru mastrena broke the day before pumpkin madness started, so we can‚Äôt pull any blonde shots and we‚Äôre down to one machine for cafe/drive/mobile. cool, we can manage, just have to be careful what order we‚Äôre pulling tickets and making drinks since there‚Äôs only one machine that can pull shots. today, decaf went down which is really great considering it is the only thing besides like herbal tea and milk that doesn‚Äôt have caffeine in it :,) oh yeah and our nitro machine works probably 2 days out of the month, to the point our SM has started consistently telling people in drive thru who try to order it ‚Äúit‚Äôs like the mcdonald‚Äôs ice cream machine, it‚Äôs never up and running haha lol‚Äù

we have no blonde espresso, no decaf espresso, no nitro, the poor baristas who end up on hot bar are dripping sweat and nearly in tears trying to keep times down and make drinks right on the ONE working machine and cold bar is running around trying to do all they can to support hot bar and keep up with their drinks too, all while we have people legitimately shrieking about pumpkin spice over the headset in drive thru. the ticket was put in for the blonde bar multiple days ago now, and lord knows how long it‚Äôs gonna take for them to come fix it. i‚Äôm just waiting to hear that our other mastrena bit the dust and we have no espresso bar whatsoever lmao. 

i just feel like the team we have is so strong, the majority of our tools and supplies are just either broken or missing completely, and we aren‚Äôt ever able to actually be set up for success due to the lack of actual tools we need to be successful to the standards they want from us

this was longer and significantly harder to follow than i meant for it to be, but that is also how every single shift i‚Äôve worked for the past week has been so it‚Äôs fitting

ps someone confirm for me that the chicken and bacon panini was discontinued bc my SM yelled at me today bc i told someone that in drive thru but the button is gone and i also actually read it somewhere probably the weekly update???? i feel insane who can relate

3984,0,"One day I decided to go to this one branch instead of Barnes and Nobles to study because I was bored. 


The first 3 minutes I sat on the table studying, this one barista said ""Hey you"" and I'm like ""me?"" She asked if I wanted this free frappe and we had a brief convo about it. I found that little interaction cute so after studying I'm like ""maybe I'll get another free frappe again if I come back"" jk I just like talking to people. 


So I went back again the next day, she asked how the frappe was, another brief convo. But that was it. I kept going everyday (I'm a 2 week regular now) she always hi to me and asks how I'm doing everyday then she started serving the drinks (the tables are kinda far off from the counter) to me that I got mixed signals if she was flirting or just being really nice.


So I asked my other barista friend if this girl was flirting and she said yes. So that made me make scenarios in my head on how would I make my move to try to get close to her that I ended up being shy when I get to the Cafe and seeing her that I acted cold and didnt even greet her. Then I realized I had a big crush on this barista.

After that, she was off for a couple of days and then when I finally saw her again, I did the same thing and acted cold. For the whole time I was there studying I wanted to talk to her but she was working and I'm shy like an anime school girl, 


I finally snapped and made a scuffed letter from scratch  
I spent the entirety of my stay working on it but in the end it was still so bad but I saw her with her bag about to leave that I had to rush my letter and I basically asked her out in it, when I saw her leave I ran to her, couldn't find my words I just said ""hey"" covering my face with my arm because I was blushing too much. Gave it to her and I ran away. 


After that I have not seen her for the past 3 days so I'm thinking maybe she quit because that interaction was the cringes thing she's seen all week. Am. I just overthinking or she hates me üò≠ 


tl;dr. Barista was really nice to me that she became my crush. 1 or 2 weeks later, I gave her a letter saying ""ur really interesting, let's go out"". I have not seen her for 3 or 4 days ever since that

I am a long-long-longtime customer of Starbucks.  I pick up coffee every morning on my way to work.  At this point, I haven‚Äôt missed a day in over two years.  Sometimes I use the drive thru, but mostly I place my order on the app and run inside to pick it up. 

What I am met with, each and every day from the baristas is a smile and a warm hello.  Yes, I‚Äôm a regular, so they all know me at this point.  But I see them do it to everyone.  Whether or not you‚Äôre asked by management to do this is beside the point.  It‚Äôs genuine, and I can tell.  

To all baristas:  Thank you.  I‚Äôm convinced you don‚Äôt hear that enough. 

Morning is an interesting time of day.  When you see your customers, their day has either gotten off to a good start, or a bad one.  Too often you‚Äôre on the front lines of someone fighting a bad day.  They make you the face of their problems and lash out, nearly always, for no reason.  I‚Äôve seen it happen. 

I can‚Äôt think of a place that requires multitasking more than Starbucks.  I watch you.  I‚Äôm in awe of you, honestly.  You are taking endless orders, all customized, while handling cash transactions and listening to gripes from customers.  And the Karens.  There are so many Karens. 

The teamwork you display on a minute-to-minute basis is inspiring.  As a hiring manager of my own firm, seeing Starbucks Barista on a resume will always get my attention.  You are such a talented and hardworking group.  You may argue that there are exceptions, and surely, anytime you employ as many as you do, there will be exceptions.  But they are so few and far between.  They are not who I‚Äôm talking to.  I‚Äôm talking to YOU.  Thank YOU. 

Your coffee literally makes my day better.  Even when there‚Äôs not enough cream.  Or too much cream.  Or it‚Äôs not hot enough.  Whatever.  It‚Äôs coffee.  The world will not begin or end with my coffee.

4102,0,"Man. I still think about my job at Starbucks and how much of a nightmare it all was. Basically, I had just graduated from college with a bachelor's of science degree. I applied for several jobs in my field, but was often shot down for not having enough experience. So I decided to just apply to Starbucks thinking it might hold me over until I find something more legitimate. I ended up getting hired. 

But man. There I was, getting paid next to nothing, getting bossed around all day by high school students, being stuck with the filthiest jobs nobody else wanted to do. I was educated with a legit science degree, probably more educated than most people there if not everyone, but everybody treated me like I was just the stuuuuupidest idiot in the whole store. They gave me barely any training at all, and then would get pissed at me or treat me like I was just an idiot if I had a question or didn't know how to do something. Anything that ever went wrong, even things that I had absolutely nothing to do with, I would get blamed for. Someone put a cafe order on the mobile order stand? I must have done it. Drive thru line moving too slowly? It couldn't be the BARISTAS in charge of making the drinks....it had to be the *stupid idiot* handing them out. I swear when working DTR or DTO, I was constantly berated over the drive thru times, even though it was obviously the baristas who were taking too long to make the drinks. Just because I happen to be working DTO, doesn't mean I have control over the drive thru times. 

I was also micromanaged to hell. Any slight thing I did differently, was the wrong way to do it. If I ran a customer's card before handing them the drink, I was berated for it. My manager would constantly be standing over my shoulder, talking to me like I was a 4 year old child explaining how to run the credit card and hand them the drink. No customer ever ONCE complained about me running their payment before handing their drink. They didn't even notice, it didn't even delay them whatsoever beyond like a second or two. If anything, they would get confused by me handing them the drink as they were handing me the card, like this awkward fumble. And then the one time I do it my manager's way, the customer's payment gets declined after I hand them the drink. Of course she wasn't around to see it, so I probably got blamed for that too. I also remember one time when it got slow and nothing was going on, so I went into the back room to take a drink of water for like 30 seconds. At which point, I was literally berated for taking a tiny break and drinking water. 

Nobody ever trusted me to work on bar. I would often get *trained* to work on bar, but then the next day I'd just be stuck on DTO or cleaning the bathrooms or some shit and never worked on bar again. I would have loved to make the drinks, like whenever I did it it was actually fun for me, and I felt like I was doing something important for once. But I was considered too stupid to ever do it. For the 6 months I worked there, I probably worked on bar for a total of 2 minutes. 

Eventually I just got so fed up. I remember one time someone who I went to high school with came in, driving a nice BMW and wearing nice clothes, clearly successful. And there I was with my little stupid green apron and hat. So embarrassing lol. I just couldn't handle thinking about what bullshit was in store for me the next day. I started showing up late, but I'd still do my job the best I could. Ended up putting in my two weeks notice, but my manager fired me literally the day before my last day, just one last ""fuck you"".  

Sometimes customers could be assholes, for sure, but the people I worked with were even worse. At least an asshole customer doesn't stick around standing over your shoulder the whole day. I recently went back to my old Starbucks and found out that hardly any of my coworkers even work there anymore. Not even my manager.",Starbucks was easily the worst job I ever had.,1661906751,"Starbucks was easily the worst job I ever had. Man.

Anything that ever went wrong, even things that I had absolutely nothing to do with, I would get blamed for. Someone put a cafe order on the mobile order stand? I must have done it. Drive thru line moving too slowly? It couldn't be the BARISTAS in charge of making the drinks....it had to be the *stupid idiot* handing them out. I swear when working DTR or DTO, I was constantly berated over the drive thru times, even though it was obviously the baristas who were taking too long to make the drinks. Just because I happen to be working DTO, doesn't mean I have control over the drive thru times. 

I was also micromanaged to hell. Any slight thing I did differently, was the wrong way to do it. If I ran a customer's card before handing them the drink, I was berated for it. My manager would constantly be standing over my shoulder, talking to me like I was a 4 year old child explaining how to run the credit card and hand them the drink. No customer ever ONCE complained about me running their payment before handing their drink. They didn't even notice, it didn't even delay them whatsoever beyond like a second or two. If anything, they would get confused by me handing them the drink as they were handing me the card, like this awkward fumble. And then the one time I do it my manager's way, the customer's payment gets declined after I hand them the drink. Of course she wasn't around to see it, so I probably got blamed for that too. I also remember one time when it got slow and nothing was going on, so I went into the back room to take a drink of water for like 30 seconds. At which point, I was literally berated for taking a tiny break and drinking water. 

Nobody ever trusted me to work on bar. I would often get *trained* to work on bar, but then the next day I'd just be stuck on DTO or cleaning the bathrooms or some shit and never worked on bar again. I would have loved to make the drinks, like whenever I did it it was actually fun for me, and I felt like I was doing something important for once. But I was considered too stupid to ever do it. For the 6 months I worked there, I probably worked on bar for a total of 2 minutes. 

Eventually I just got so fed up. I remember one time someone who I went to high school with came in, driving a nice BMW and wearing nice clothes, clearly successful. And there I was with my little stupid green apron and hat. So embarrassing lol. I just couldn't handle thinking about what bullshit was in store for me the next day. I started showing up late, but I'd still do my job the best I could. Ended up putting in my two weeks notice, but my manager fired me literally the day before my last day, just one last ""fuck you"".  

Sometimes customers could be assholes, for sure, but the people I worked with were even worse. At least an asshole customer doesn't stick around standing over your shoulder the whole day. I recently went back to my old Starbucks and found out that hardly any of my coworkers even work there anymore. Not even my manager."

I've inquired about open positions at some of the local stores within 5 miles of were I live (There are 4 stores) and the Store managers have told me that Starbucks has never offered seasonal positions for employees and that Starbucks recently implemented a minimum amount of required hours worked by partners of 12 hours per week, and a minimum of 17 hours of posted availability.

Me: what size? 
Customer: venti 
Me: with water or lemonade? 
Customer: make it with whatever it usually comes with
Me: it can come with either one 
Customer: lemonade then 

Just a tip to customers. Whenever you order ALWAYS order with the size FIRST and if it‚Äôs hot or iced. 
Good Example: I would like a Venti Iced Caramel macchiato
Bad Example: I would like a caramel macchiato 

You can even say small, medium, or large, we know what you mean. DO NOT say ‚Äúregular size‚Äù. 

At the window, DO NOT WAIT until I have handed you ALL of your items to ask for things. If we are waiting on something or even when I take your payment, ask then. This includes straws, napkins, cream, sugar, stoppers, sleeves, bag, cup of water. It‚Äôs a massive waste of time. 
 
Baristas aren‚Äôt technically allowed to offer straws for drinks that do not require one as our cups are literally meant to be used without a straw. 

It‚Äôs very frustrating when I‚Äôm doing solo DT and a customer is waiting on their drink and waits for me to hand it to them to ask for a straw. I am already slower as I‚Äôm solo but it slows me down even more when people do that. On top of that, just ask for everything you want.

1. Absorb as much as you can from your training and never be afraid to ask for help.

2. Try out other brands of espresso, starbucks isn't that good tbh.

3. Its not a bad thing if you're not always on bar. Others need a turn and you might just aide your team better somewhere else.

4. We are a team. Not everyone gets along but try to support your team as much as you can. It makes for an easier shift. 

5. Be kind to your openers, odds are they have the highest traffic hours. This is a coffee shop.

6. Your closers want to know what you need to open. They don't need to know every little thing that was wrong.

7. If you're opening, fully prep and stock everything you can think of. It can turn your whole shift around.

8. Do NOT live and die for this job. It can be fun but its a job. Your joints and bones are not worth the wear and tear. 

9. If you're a high schooler be respectful of your full time partners. This job is their livelihood and not always a fun place for you to chitchat and play around in. 

10. Stores that gossip all the time are not worth the hassle.

11. Grow a thick skin. The things customers say and do to us can be vile and rude. I promise holding on to any of it will hurt more than you need. 

12. Find your regulars, these customers will be the best you have ever known and are more than worth the trouble of others. 

13. Unionize. Your managers are more often than not, not a good source of information about unions and cooperate does not care about us 

14. Do not be afraid to speak up against your shifts to your manager if something wrong is happening. Your concerns deserve to be heard

4297,0,"The good ol' shaken espresso with no ice bullshit. We have a new regular who has been ordering this drink. Venti Shaken Espresso, No ice, No Classic, with Almond Milk. Naturally when I arrived at this drink while bar supporting I told the baristas to let me know when this person showed up so I could explain that this drink isn't meant to be made this way. The baristas informed me that this regular is deaf and they have a hard time communicating with them so all of them have just been making a Venti Iced Quad Latte with no ice, essentially. 

Today I got the mobile order again so I wrote on the cup ""This needs to be ordered as a latte, thanks."" I genuinely am not trying to be rude, I just want them to get what they want and understand that a shaken espresso is not what they are actually ordering. I'm not sure what will happen next or if they even noticed the note however I'm not going to give someone special treatment just because they are deaf/hard of hearing. Actually I find it quite rude when someone acts entitled because of a disability. I try extremely hard to treat everyone the same, equally, no matter who they are or how I feel about them (if I know them well). Everyone deserves to be treated fairly. I feel as though it is not fair to give this one person a pass just because they aren't willing to try and communicate with us.

That being said, I'm not sure if anyone has ever actually explained to them that this drink cannot be shaken and *IS,* in fact, an iced latte. I guess we'll see. I have not checked the price difference on a venti shaken espresso vs a venti iced quad latte. I don't know what the correct way to go about this is, I'm just hoping maybe next time I can actually talk with her somehow to help clarify what these drinks are so that she can order exactly what she wants.

What would you do in this situation? Am I wrong for writing a note on her drink? Was I rude and/or inconsiderate?

I then looked up the iced chai latter and it's even more sugar at 61g for the venti. I get the chai frap 3-4x/wk fyi

Can someone explain how that works? someone else kindly answered in another post that sugar is pre-added to the chai mix which explains a lot. Is there another syrup added or is the ""chai mix"" just chai and sugar?

Any suggestions on less sugary drinks I would like based on my taste preferences?

I like chai, cinnamon, caramel, mocha, espresso (?), cold drinks preferred

Can't do nut milks

I'm def going to spend an afternoon playing around with diff recipes online to make a dupe of the chai frap with less sugar. Just waiting on a delivery of xanthum gum...

I was trained for my position by my store manager and we haven't hired a brand new shift since I've been there. We've just had people transfer in who had some prior experience as a shift. So I was just wondering if only store managers can train baristas to become shifts, or if it's possible for a shift supervisor to train people to become shift supervisors? I ask because we just had this new shift transfer in and he only had a little experience as a shift, but did all his training already, but my manager had me run a bunch of shifts with him to train him. But it was just me like free wheeling it based on how I know to do the job. It wasn't like I was using modules or anything. And like I said he had done the training so he knew like how cash management and stuff worked, but I was more explaining like when to do what things and like the flow of the store.  


Anyways, I really loved training him and I realized I miss training newbies. I've trained like 7 green beans and I almost always love the experience I have with them. 2 of my trainees have become Shift Supervisors and pretty quickly too. And I'm super proud of both of them.

I put off my education because I was so invested in moving up the latter. I only hung out with coworkers and I constantly thought and spoke about Starbucks in social settings. My friends that didn‚Äôt work for the company found it very annoying.

One year later, I am a different person. I have a 4.0 gpa in college, employed at a local coffee shop making more tips and better hours, and more importantly, my relationship with my close friends that never worked for the BUX improved immensely. There are times where I do miss working for the company and the few good customers that made it a positive experience, but I remind myself of how horrible of a time it was while working there. 

My current job, we are required to sign an NDA to prevent any sort of workplace hostility such as gossiping about coworkers.

To all the baristas out there, you are all doing a great job. I understand that most people who move up do not deserve to be in the positions they‚Äôre in, but try to overcome it and prevent engaging in any sort of negative interactions with other baristas, SSVs, SMs and even DMs. We all hate the cliques, gossiping, the unsupportive behavior, nepotism, favoritism and horrible customers, but remember YOU are wonderful as a person. Don‚Äôt let Starbucks consume you and make it your personality, it will hold you back and possibly fall into a depression like I did. Go in, do your job, and go home. North Star? Third place? Customer connection? Do the bare minimum. The company can care less about you and replace you in an instant, so as I said, don‚Äôt let it become you. If you need the job, then stay. If you want to move up, that is also good too, just remember who you are deep down inside. Life outside of Starbucks is great.

I know that Starbucks has a white chocolate mocha and I tried a tall once (with only the soy milk as a modification) and although I could tell it was good, I wanted something a bit sweeter and lighter but with caffeine, still.

I‚Äôve been working at starbucks for about a month and 2 weeks, including training. I‚Äôm still struggling a lot. It‚Äôs a combination of things that are making me feel behind, but if I had to simplify it then I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a mix of subpar training and my natural tendency to be bad at details. 

I trained at a different store because there were a lot of new hires. A lot of the training was online. I was able to practice a bit of CS and P.O.S. and I only got about 2 days on bar. There were a lot of things I was only told or shown once very quickly with little to no practice that I had a hard time remembering. 

I was lucky enough to get retrained for 3 more days after a few weeks of a lot of mistakes, and I feel a lot better with the job. The only issue is that now everyone knows me as an anxious mess so I‚Äôm not well respected. Some people are nice but others don‚Äôt give me the benefit of the doubt anymore. I feel more secure in my knowledge of the job now because I had a chance to ask all my questions, and get told all the rules and terms I didn‚Äôt even know existed up until that point. But I‚Äôm still working on speed and accuracy. I generally am bad with nit picky details. So even when I know what to do I mess up a lot, particularly on POS. (eg. accidentally charging for milk when you shouldn‚Äôt, accidentally scanning RTDNE items twice)

So, one of my shifts is really fed up with me. She‚Äôs new to the store and is a very detail oriented person. Knows how to do her job fairly well since she‚Äôs been at it for so long but in my opinion has difficulty with in the moment improvisation, which I feel is equally important. I feel like much of the time things inevitably can go wrong or slower than expected but she typically struggles to adapt to it and gets visibly frustrated. In moments like this she struggles with multitasking and lacks the ability to give clear instructions while she‚Äôs doing other things. Most people don‚Äôt get in any trouble for it because they already know how to do their jobs even without her instruction and have a reputation for being good at what they do already. 

She‚Äôs definitely more by the book than my other shifts. She always picks up on the little details I miss and gets really upset with me. Sometimes she feels guilty and starts being nice out of nowhere, but ultimately always falls back on getting openly fed up with me for something or another. Even off the floor she thinks I‚Äôm incompetent and doesn‚Äôt trust that I have any common sense. She doubts most things that I say even while we‚Äôre having small talk. And hasn‚Äôt asked me for permission before keeping me late twice now. Whenever something is off I‚Äôm the first person she blames for it. I get that sometimes I get anxious and have trouble doing the job completely correctly but she doesn‚Äôt respect me as a person. She‚Äôs open to other people about how much I hold her back and I feel like if I can‚Äôt do my job perfectly in the next few days she‚Äôs going to try to get me fired. She openly can‚Äôt stand me and looks exasperated just being around me. She‚Äôs right to be upset, there are a lot of things she‚Äôs had to tell me to do multiple times that I blatantly can‚Äôt remember or get right. But I feel completely and utterly disrespected by her in general and I think she truly has a problem with me. 

That said, do shifts have a lot of authority over who gets let go or at least in a lot of trouble? 

If you asked my other coworkers or shifts then they probably wouldn‚Äôt think I‚Äôm very competent either. But when my other shifts notice me make mistakes they are way more forgiving or able to improvise with it as it happens even if they are frustrated for a second. 

So yeah I keep making small detail oriented mistakes. More examples would be queueing shots before milk.. fumbling with cash.. being slow on CS.. asking if they want sweetener for the wrong drinks‚Ä¶ not putting names on every order‚Ä¶ 

I understand that my mistakes slow down the rest of the floor and I feel truly remorseful for it.

Me: we can do the iced americano for you instead!

Her: is that espresso?

Me: Yup, it's made with decaf espresso and water, so it tastes just like a coffee.

Her: But it's espresso.

Me: yup!

Her: so it had caffeine 

Me: well it has a tiny bit of caffeine, but just like a regular decaf coffee has a little caffeine. But it IS decaf.

Me: yes. 

Her: and espresso has caffeine.

Her: yeah.

Me: what size?

Her: tall

Me: and anything in that...? Sweetener? Any kind of milk?

Her: light heavy cream.

Me: anything else? ^no *total*

Then she gets to the window and the bar partner has by mistake made it hot. *Remade* then she said is tastes wrong. But won't clarify what tastes wrong about it. Then finally the DTR figures out that she's is mad that the heavy cream is mixed in. So we remake is and CAREFULLY all pass it to the DTR partner trying not to wiggle it at all so the HEAVY MILK doesn't FOLLOW THE LAWS OF GRAVITY and mix in.

I CLEARLY used the word ""decaf"" 800 times. The DTO screen CLEARLY listed a DECAF iced americano. What is happening!!!??? Excuse me while I bang my head into the counter to make it end. 

Bonus story: had someone idle as the dt window for 12 minutes this morning before we opened. Car behind him, also waiting for the window, instead of... A parking spot? or even the order box? was there, idling 9 minutes to open, and then one more car at the speaker box 2 minutes to open.

My coworker took this lady‚Äôs order and she got a frap with 6 shots and a sandwich. My coworker told me that she wanted the frap split into to cups. I told her to tell her that our policy doesn‚Äôt allow us to do that. The most I can do is give her an empty cup so she can do it herself. My coworker was scared to tell her this and she asked me if I can do it. Mind you, this lady is already at the window and starring me down while I make her frap. She was eyeing me the whole time when I poured her frap into the cup and rinsed out the blender. As soon as I opened the window this lady raised her voice and asked me why I dumped the rest of the left over drink that was in the blender down the sink. That I could have used the left over to pour to the second cup. I apologized and said that it is company‚Äôs policy that I‚Äôm not allowed to split it into two cups, the most I can do is give her an empty cup. She yelled at me and said ‚Äúwell why didn‚Äôt you tell me that in the first place! I paid for six shots of espresso!‚Äù I told her I‚Äôm so sorry but some baristas do not know that policy. She kept yelling and wanted a refund. She snatched the receipt and the pen out of my hand to sign the receipt. I explained that it would take at least 3-5 business days for the money to go back into your card and she went ballistic. I mean a full tantrum. Full screaming, full flailing her harms and pounding on the steering wheel saying that she was left with $20 and she needs her money now.

I as you will see I started working at Starbucks 2 weeks ago. So far enjoying it.

I think Starbucks is unique in the sense that our menu is very large and extensive and making all the drinks to the desired specifications is sometimes challenging.

The hot and the cold bar.¬†the steps the works 

I think the existence of such a game will reduce the training time, and resources spent training and will be a quality of life improvement for baristas trying to learn! It will make us learn quickly so we can go through all the recipes and learn more quickly. New recipes can also be added quickly if training can be done quickly.

¬†If you guys know anyone in corporate who could give me some resources to make this, that would be awesome !!¬†  
I know I am a very low-level person working in the company but I feel like I can help make this training process fun and intuitive. I Did this in a day imagine if I get the proper resources to build this complete game how much easy training will be and how fun it will be !!!  

This is just something that I thought of It's okay if you guys don't want to do it LOL this I did just for fun!

I am not a dietician, but this is what I do to limit the added sugar in my drinks!

I tell them send a message in the group chat and see if anyone can cover the shift, and I‚Äôll ask the partner on shift if they can. They inform me that they already asked 20ish minutes ago. I tell her to give our sm a text or call and let them know the situation. 20 minutes go by and I get a text message from my sm to call them. So, I‚Äôm assuming they‚Äôre about to let me know if we‚Äôll have to close earlier since they is no closer. I let my partner know that I have to give our sm a quick call. I step to the BOH and do just that while trying to make a dent in the massive pile of dishes we have.

Annoyingly, I tell them again what I did(asked the partner to message the group, asked partner on shift) they then tell me the partner should not have texted/called them and that I should have called around to other stores before coming to them. I proceed to tell them that we are slammed, I only have one other partner on the floor, and a backlog of task I need to do and I didn‚Äôt have time to look up other store numbers and ask if they have any partners that could close for us. They then proceeds to say that I make 20$ a hour and I need to own it(this is the comment I‚Äôm concerned about) that they have coverage for me, and asked me to assure them that I will better utilize the ACT model.

Right after I let my old SM know I was wanting to transfer, they left for another store. They weren't able to transfer me before they left, and them leaving pretty much put my old store into SM purgatory. From the moment they left to until when I moved, we never had a permanent SM. We alternated between being watched over by an ASM-in-training, an SM-in-training, and an SM of another store in our district that was training to be DM. Despite this, I was assured multiple times that my transfer would be completed in time for me to move. 

That didn't happen, though. To this day, I'm still in the system as working at my old store. I bothered the shit out of everyone I could think of, hoping that *someone* could help me transfer, but to no avail. I was told that since my old store doesn't officially have an SM, no one has ""access""  to transfer me except the DM, who seems either unable or unwilling to.

To make matters worse, the SM at my new store told me that I would start this week but I've only worked two shifts so far and I'm currently not scheduled *at all* for this week, next week, or the week after.

I told her it did but it was not as much as what was in the coffee we served. She then begin to ask for it ‚Äúchild friendly‚Äù instead. I insisted that I could not remove the caffeine for the drink and suggested an apple juice instead which was the only thing that I could think of in the moment without caffeine. She got mad at me and said she didn‚Äôt believe me because she saw several young girls outside all with refreshers. I had served them several minutes prior and knew that 1. these girls where in high school and 2. they did not care about the caffeine in their drinks (half of them gout ice coffee or vanilla lattes). When I told her that they had received the drinks with caffeine she seemed to still not believe me and instead just ordered herself a drink and then left the store. Not even a minute later, I saw her walk up to the group of girls outside. I don‚Äôt know what they said but after they talked she walked away and left without her drink. I threw it away like an hour later."

4841,0,"How long does ethics give decision after the investigation?

This will be a pretty long story/rant. Please try to understand as English is not my first language 

2 partners filed an ethics complaint plus 2 incident reports (a witness report and a green bean) against the same SSV.

SSV apparently called a partner from a minority a slave. Partner reported the incident to the manager but manager just shrugged the incident off and even told the partner to not tell it to other partners as manager is afraid that other partners will get mad at ssv and will bully ssv. We already knew that this SSV and SM are particularly close and lets SSV gets away from any complaints. Instead of giving SSV corrective action or coaching for the racism issue, SM nitpicks on the partner for every little thing even some things aren't true. There was also a second time with the same partner where SSV asked if partner lives on a gh**to area. Partner also reported the incident but nothing was done. So we convinced partner to call ethics instead. Partner was able to talk to the DM before they moved to another province. Partner later found out that our SM called the store sm that they're going to transfer to and said bad things about partner to prevent partner from being accepted to the store.

Another ethics complaint and 2 IR are related.
SSV aggressively followed a green bean from inside the store to the parking lot and yelled at green bean in front of many customers and partners which I feel is against third place policy and anti-harassment. Even though green bean didn't notify ssv (which SSV IS hardly on the floor working) that GB clocked out, SSV should just coach GB properly. GB told the incident to SM but blamed GB instead on how GB is being inconsiderate and non-cooperative. GB told another SSV about what happened and felt it was unfair so they filed a complaint for GB. GB and other witnesses also filed incident reports which notified our SM and it pissed our SM off. The investigation started 2 weeks ago where DM asked people who filed the ir and complaints as well as other baristas.


  Many partners also talked to SSV and SM directly on how SSV is being aggressive and acting like a bully to other partners(especially green beans) instead of coaching them properly but nothing happens to ssv instead SM nitpicks/blames partners who complains about SSV and sometimes would cut their hours.


TL;DR 
Partners filed ethics complaints and incident reports against the same SSV for racism and being a bully towards green beans. Partners tried to have a talk several times with SSV and SM for the aggressive behavior but no corrective action is taken and SM is always covering up SSV.  Investigation was started 2-3 weeks ago and partners are losing hope that the results will still fall into SSV's favor.

Wasn't the most pleasing guy to look and the ugly friend of my group when I was younger to Being told by men and women I'm really good looking often and all my friends sort of following my lead. All that is cool and all but it causes a lot of unwanted attention for a man who still hasn't left their ugly duck mindset.

It may seems like I'm being braggadocios I apologize if anyone is taking it that way but I'm only pointing this out because I feel like its effecting my work. So as we all know Starbucks is a very female dominated brand. From the customers to the staff (At least in my store) I'm starting to have women compliment me a lot. Which is so cool because I know a lot of people are shy but I have no idea how to respond without being awkward.

 I don't want to come off as unapproachable but I keep messing these things up dude.

My manger is the best she always gives me reassurance but I'm starting to think that's just because she may fancy me (Not just based of that, there are other things I don't need to go in detail about)

 I don't want anyone to think I'm unapproachable or stuck up when I'm really just to in my own head. I have a fellow barista who is pretty cute she looks like Zoe Kravitz who's my celebrity crush. This girl has thrown me so many ""Just fucking interact with me you curly headed bastard"" signs and tried sparking conversations and I still overthink saying a simple hi and bye to her

You may read that thinking *""how can you know all this and not be confident enough to converse""* and it comes down to being that guy who would think someone is flirting with him when they were actually doing the complete opposite. I'm not dumb after awhile I can start to tell this isn't just them being nice but Id rather deny and be safe then sorry.

My manger is the best she always gives me reassurance but I'm starting to think that's just because she may fancy me (Not just based of that, there are other things I don't need to go in detail about)

 I don't want anyone to think I'm unapproachable or stuck up when I'm really just to in my own head. I have a fellow barista who is pretty cute she looks like Zoe Kravitz who's my celebrity crush. This girl has thrown me so many ""Just fucking interact with me you curly headed bastard"" signs and tried sparking conversations and I still overthink saying a simple hi and bye to her

You may read that thinking *""how can you know all this and not be confident enough to converse""* and it comes down to being that guy who would think someone is flirting with him when they were actually doing the complete opposite. I'm not dumb after awhile I can start to tell this isn't just them being nice but Id rather deny and be safe then sorry.

I hope this didn't come off too dating advice-ey Because at the end of the day my fear comes from losing my job and intimidating others, not loss of possible dates. 

Are there any other long term shy partners out there? Or shy barista turned into a outgoing one? Id love some advice from both sides I don't plan to be like this forever"

4905,0,"Hey y‚Äôall! I had a friend who was a barista across the street from my retail job a few years ago, and he always made me a grande Starbucks Doubleshot on Ice, with white mocha instead of classic. 
It was an AMAZING drink, sweet enough but still with a really strong espresso flavor, but now that the doubleshot has been replaced with the shaken espresso, my drinks have been so inconsistent. 
I really just want the old recipe, 3 shots of espresso shaken with 3 pumps of white mocha, with a splash of milk/cream on top. But whenever I try to modify the drink, it still is always SOOO milky! Even when I tell the baristas I don‚Äôt care if the cup is filled to the top alll the way or not. (I definitely get why they do that, seeing all the posts on this sun about customers complaining lol)

Hey y‚Äôall! I had a friend who was a barista across the street from my retail job a few years ago, and he always made me a grande Starbucks Doubleshot on Ice, with white mocha instead of classic. 
It was an AMAZING drink, sweet enough but still with a really strong espresso flavor, but now that the doubleshot has been replaced with the shaken espresso, my drinks have been so inconsistent. 
I really just want the old recipe, 3 shots of espresso shaken with 3 pumps of white mocha, with a splash of milk/cream on top. But whenever I try to modify the drink, it still is always SOOO milky! Even when I tell the baristas I don‚Äôt care if the cup is filled to the top alll the way or not. (I definitely get why they do that, seeing all the posts on this sun about customers complaining lol)

Ex-partner x2 here. I worked at Starbucks 2013-2018, then Mar 2021 - Oct 2021 before landing (what I thought was) a more stable full time job. 

Spoiler alert: it was not.

Now I‚Äôm thinking about returning to Starbucks. I will say, I definitely enjoyed my time during my first five years more than I enjoyed it this last time. With the recipe changes, new policies, COVID, it wasn‚Äôt my favorite - plus I was starting at an EXTREMELY high volume store for our area, and they didn‚Äôt really train me again because I‚Äôd spent five years with the company previously. (Which is whatever, but things had changed, so it would‚Äôve been nice to know them beforehand and not told them while doing something wrong on the floor.)

I don‚Äôt think the pay has changed for every store in my area, though. Last year, I was making $13 for the few months I spent as a SSV, but I know they were talking about raising pay. I see barista postings on indeed around here from $10-$15 an hour, so who knows. 

But I‚Äôm only making $16 now, they‚Äôre cutting my hours, and I‚Äôm considering moving back to the bux and working my way up this time. As long as I can find a location around me paying at least $15.

SO. Baristas and SSVs of Reddit, how are we liking it nowadays? I know the company is under a lot of fire for the union stuff, but as a day to day job, how are we feeling? Pros/cons? Advice? Etc?

I'm excited for the job and think it will be a good change of pace from the work I'm normally used to, but since I've never worked for SBUX before, I'm not sure what I should ask for as a starting wage.
